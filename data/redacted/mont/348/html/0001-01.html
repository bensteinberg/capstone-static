    <p id="b24-5" data-blocks='[["BL_24.6",24,[170,411,1322,284]]]'>¶1 J.D.L. appeals from a judgment entered in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, involuntarily committing him to the Montana State Hospital (MSH). J.D.L. raises several issues. However, because we hold the District Court erred in not appointing a friend for J.D.L., as required by § 53-21-122(2), MCA, we need not discuss other issues.</p>
    <p id="b24-6" data-blocks='[["BL_24.7",24,[171,708,1323,436]]]'>¶2 On October 4, 2007, police took J.D.L. to an emergency room for causing a “severe disturbance” at his apartment building. Dr. Brown, a professional person, was called to evaluate J.D.L.’s mental status and to make recommendations. After Dr. Brown evaluated J.D.L., he wrote a report in which he recommended that J.D.L. be committed to MSH because he represented a danger to others. Dr. Brown’s report was attached to the State’s petition to commit J.D.L. At J.D.L.’s initial appearance on October 4, the District Court asked defense counsel about appointing a friend as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b24-7" data-blocks='[["BL_24.8",24,[261,1151,1232,82]]]'>COURT: And then how about a friend, do we have a suggestion for friend?</blockquote>

    <p id="b24-12" data-blocks='[["BL_24.13",24,[172,1541,1321,238]]]'>¶3 The District Court then entered an order setting the hearing on the petition for the next day, October 5. No friend for J.D.L. was appointed. There was no further discussion concerning the appointment of a friend and no friend for J.D.L. appeared at the hearing on the petition.</p>
    <p id="b24-13" data-blocks='[["BL_24.14",24,[172,1786,1323,436]]]'>¶4 During the hearing, Dr. Brown, who was the only witness, testified he diagnosed J.D.L. as suffering from schizophrenia and polysubstance dependence. Dr. Brown opined that J.D.L. was substantially unable to care for his basic needs because he had no food in his apartment, he could lose his apartment, and he represented an imminent threat of injury to himself or others. Dr. Brown reiterated his recommendation that J.D.L. be committed to MSH because it would be the least restrictive means of treatment. The District Court granted the State’s petition and involuntarily committed J.D.L.</p>

Section 53-21-102(8), MCA; <em>Mental Health of D.V., </em>¶ 36. The friend of the respondent may, in consort with counsel, waive some of the respondent’s rights. Section 53-21-119, MCA. The appointment of a friend of the respondent in an involuntary commitment is important. The appointment of a friend may not be arbitrarily dispensed with by the District Court. Ultimately, it is the trial judge’s responsibility to ensure a friend is appointed.</p>

I do not agree with the entirety of the analysis, however. The requirement that the District Court appoint a “friend” is a sound one, as anyone familiar with-and concerned about-the proper handling of involuntary commitment proceedings knows. A “friend” of the respondent plays many important <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>roles-to the respondent, to respondent’s counsel and to the district court.</p>
    <p id="b27-4" data-blocks='[["BL_27.4",27,[99,428,1325,584]]]'>¶15 I write separately to encourage the Legislature to revisit and clarify certain matters relating to the appointment of a friend. It is beyond cavil that the presiding judge is to make the appointment. Nothing in the statutes, however, places the responsibility on anyone involved in the proceedings to make a serious attempt to locate a friend for appointment. Thus, notwithstanding the Court’s implication at ¶ 12 that the presiding judge must make a serious effort to <em>appoint </em>a friend, the presiding judge certainly should not-and properly cannot-shoulder the responsibility for making a serious effort to <em>locate </em>a friend for appointment. Nor does it seem appropriate for the prosecutor to bear that burden. The Legislature may want to consider clearly placing the responsibility on counsel for the respondent.</p>
    <p id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.5",27,[98,1019,1324,384]]]'>¶16 In addition, as the Court suggests in ¶ 11, there may be situations where-after a serious effort to locate a friend is made-no such person can be located. In this regard, I would encourage the Legislature to carve out a very narrow and carefully circumscribed exception to the requirement that a friend be appointed for application in such circumstances. Here again, though, I must note my disagreement with the Court’s implication that it is the district court’s responsibility to find a person to serve as a friend.</p>
    <p id="b27-6" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[96,1411,1325,231]]]'>¶17 The bottom line in this case is that no one made an attempt at locating a friend for the respondent, even after the District Court advised counsel that it would be “good” if one could be lined up. Consequently, no friend was appointed. For that reason, I concur in the result the Court reaches in this case.</p>

Plain error review is to be exercised “sparingly” and only when a failure to do so will “leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.” <em>State v. Hayden, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2008%20MT%20274" class="citation" data-index="39">2008 MT 274</a>, ¶ 17, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=345%20Mont.%20252" class="citation" data-index="40">345 Mont. 252</a>, ¶ 17, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=190%20P.3d%201091" class="citation" data-index="41">190 P.3d 1091</a>, ¶ 17. Despite these high standards, the Court reverses without any explanation of how the fundamental fairness of this commitment proceeding was left unsettled, or how the integrity of the judicial process was compromised. J.D.L. has made no showing that the absence of a court-appointed friend had any impact whatsoever on the commitment proceedings. The Court likewise fails, offering merely that appointment of a friend “is important” and “may not be arbitrarily dispensed with” by a district court. Opinion, ¶ 11. While I agree with <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>
