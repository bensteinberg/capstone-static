    <p id="b356-12" data-blocks='[["BL_356.13",356,[181,1376,1322,388]]]'>¶4 Gannett owns an affiliated group (Gannett Group) of newspaper publishing and television broadcasting corporations. GANSAT is a first-tier subsidiary of Gannett. GANSAT publishes the <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>and distributes the <em>USA Today </em>within Montana. GANSAT was the only member of the Gannett Group doing business in Montana in 2000. As a result, GANSAT served as the “taxpayer” for corporation license tax purposes and was the only member of the Gannett Group to file a Montana corporation license tax return.</p>
    <p id="b356-13" data-blocks='[["BL_356.14",356,[182,1772,1326,328]]]'>¶5 Gannett acquired Cablevision’s cable television business as part of its acquisition of Multimedia, Inc. (Multimedia), in 1995. Cablevision, a subsidiary of Multimedia, became a second-tier subsidiary of Gannett. Gannett sold Cablevision for over $2.5 billion in 2000. GANSAT deducted the gain recognized from the sale of Cablevision as nonbusiness income on its 2000 Montana corporation license tax return.</p>
    <p id="b356-14" data-blocks='[["BL_356.15",356,[182,2114,1322,191]],["BL_357.1",357,[69,339,1326,91]]]'>¶6 The State of Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) denied GANSAT’s deduction. GANSAT appealed to STAB. GANSAT arpied that DOR improperly had included Cablevision in the same unitary group with Gannett and GANSAT. GANSAT further argued that DOR <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>improperly had denied a nonbusiness income deduction for the gain generated from the Cablevision sale pursuant to § 15-31-302(1), MCA.</p>
    <p id="AJ1" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[69,439,1330,434]]]'>¶7 STAB granted partial summary judgment to DOR. STAB announced in an initial ruling that § 15-31-302(1), MCA, clearly states “two separate clauses which must be considered in determining whether income is business or nonbusiness income ... a ‘transactional’ and a ‘functional’ test for business income.” STAB did not determine whether GANSAT actually owed corporate tax on the sale of Cablevision. STAB separately determined that Gannett, GANSAT, and Cablevision comprised the same unitary group for the purpose of determining corporate tax owing in Montana.</p>
    <p id="b357-3" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[66,881,1327,438]]]'>¶8 GANSAT and DOR filed a joint interlocutory appeal with the District Court pursuant to § 15-2-305, MCA. The parties requested the District Court to rule on STAB’s construction of § 15-31-302(1), MCA, as containing two separate tests for business income, due to the effect of this conclusion of law on the remaining issues before STAB. The District Court granted the petition for an interlocutory appeal. The District Court affirmed STAB’s interpretation of § 15-31-302(1), MCA, as containing a transactional test and a functional test for determining business income. GANSAT appeals.</p>

The UDITPA has two main objectives: (1) to promote uniformity in allocation practices among the states that impose taxes on the income of corporations, and (2) to relieve the pressure for congressional legislation in this field.

    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[195,1273,1328,477]]]'>¶13 Montana uses the UDITPA’s definitions to divide all corporate income into two categories-“business income” and “nonbusiness income.” <em>Compare </em>UDITPA § 1, <em>7A </em>U.L.A. 147; <em>with </em>§§ 15-31-302 and 15-1-601, Art. IV, MCA. All business income is “apportioned to this state” through a formula based on the property, sales, and payroll of the taxpayer. Sections 15-31-305 to 312, MCA.

    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.7",358,[196,1765,1327,485]]]'>¶14 We turn to the definition of business income as set forth in § 15-31-302(1), MCA. The statute defines “[bjusiness income” as “income arising from the transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer’s trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer’s regular trade or business operations.” Section 15-31-302(1), MCA. “Nonbusiness income” simply “means all income other than business income.” Section 15-31-302(4), MCA.

The second clause provides that business income “includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer’s regular trade or business operations.”</p>
    <p id="b359-3" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[78,688,1324,436]]]'>¶16 GANSAT contends that the District Court’s interpretation of the statute renders the first clause “mere surplusage.” GANSAT instead suggests that the second clause modifies the first clause. GANSAT argues that Montana’s definition of business income consists of a single transactional test. DOR agrees with the District Court that the second clause constitutes a separate “functional test” for determining whether certain income is business income. The Multistate Tax Commission supports DOR’s position that the statutory definition of business income contains a separate functional test.</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.5",359,[75,1133,1332,629]]]'>¶17 A majority of jurisdictions interpret the UDITPA’s definition of business income to include a separate functional test for business income. <em>Hoechst, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20P.3d%20324" class="citation" data-index="14">22 P.3d at 336</a>. Some glean the functional test from the UDITPA’s plain language. <em>See, e.g., Polaroid, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=507%20S.E.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="15">507 S.E.2d at 289-93</a>; <em>The Kroger Company v.

Others find the definition of business income ambiguous, and construe the statute to include the functional test using extrinsic aids, such as the UDITPA’s legislative history and the UDITPA’s policy and goals. <em>See, e.g., Hoechst, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20P.3d%20324" class="citation" data-index="17">22 P.3d at 332-41</a>. All of these jurisdictions conclude that the functional test includes corporate income as business income if it arises from the disposition of an asset that the taxpayer had used in the regular course of its business. <em>See, e.g., Hoechst, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20P.3d%20324" class="citation" data-index="18">22 P.3d at 337</a>.</p>

We could read the statute grammatically as: “‘Business income’ means income arising from the transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer’s trade or business and [business income] includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations.” <em>Hoechst, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20P.3d%20324" class="citation" data-index="40">22 </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20P.3d%20324" class="citation" data-index="40">P.3d at 333</a>; <em>Polaroid, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=507%20S.E.2d%20284" class="citation" data-index="41">507 S.E.2d at 290</a>.</p>

The District Court concluded that to read the statute as containing only a transactional test essentially would erase the second clause of the statute.

Indeed, to construe § 15-31-302(1), MCA, as containing only a single transactional test would result in a single state reaping all of the tax revenue from a unitary business’s sale of property in that particular state.

Montana would ignore the asset’s role in the unitary business if it determined the sale to be unusual or extraordinary. Montana would allocate the entire gain to Montana. California and Oregon, by contrast, would apportion a share of the gain to their respective states, under the independent functional test applied in those jurisdictions, because the assets proved integral to the taxpayer’s unitary business. <em>Simpson Timber, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=953%20P.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="79">953 P.2d at 370</a>.</p>
