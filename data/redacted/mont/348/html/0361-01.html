    <p id="b384-11" data-blocks='[["BL_384.13",384,[169,1192,1328,333]]]'>¶4 The State charged Heath on February 27,2001, with one count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. The State amended its information on May 7, 2001, to include a count of Tampering with a Witness. A jury convicted Heath of both counts on March 11, 2002. Steven Hudspeth (Hudspeth) represented Heath for the maj ority of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. Hudspeth withdrew as Heath’s attorney of record after Heath’s conviction and first sentencing.</p>
    <p id="b384-12" data-blocks='[["BL_384.14",384,[169,1533,1323,285]]]'>¶5 This Court affirmed Heath’s convictions, but reversed his sentence and remanded the case back to the District Court for resentencing. <em>State v.

The District Court re-sentenced Heath on March 21, 2004. Heath appealed his new sentence and we denied his appeal. <em>State v.

    <p id="b384-13" data-blocks='[["BL_384.15",384,[169,1826,1323,237]]]'>¶6 Heath timely filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the District Court on February 7, 2007. Heath alleged that Hudspeth had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Heath also claimed that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to raise a restitution issue on direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b384-14" data-blocks='[["BL_384.16",384,[170,2071,1322,286]],["BL_385.1",385,[107,317,1325,187]]]'>¶7 David Avery (Avery) served as Heath’s initial counsel for post-conviction purposes. Avery requested that Hudspeth answer Heath’s allegations through an affidavit to be attached as an exhibit to Heath’s petition. Hudspeth declined. Hudspeth instead stated that he would answer the petition’s assertions at a hearing. Heath’s petition therefore requested that the District Court hold a hearing. Heath’s <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>petition further requested the District Court to order the State to respond to Heath’s petition and to allow Heath to reply to the State’s response, “[i]n the interests of clarifying the issues to be addressed at such a hearing.”</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[107,514,1330,480]]]'>¶8 The State moved the District Court for an order directing Hudspeth to respond within 20 days to the charges in Heath’s petition. The State filed its motion pursuant to <em>In re Petition of Gillham, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=216%20Mont.%20279" class="citation" data-index="6">216 Mont. 279</a>, 282, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%201019" class="citation" data-index="7">704 P.2d 1019</a>, 1021 (1985), on the ground that “a response from counsel is necessary in order to answer the charges of ineffective assistance.” The District Court, upon considering the State’s motion “and good cause appearing therefrom,” ordered Hudspeth to respond by affidavit to the specific charges of ineffective assistance of counsel within 20 days. Hudspeth shortly thereafter took his own life without having filed the affidavit ordered by the District Court.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[107,1002,1326,385]]]'>¶9 Heath filed a Motion for Hearing and Guidance from the Court. Heath requested the District Court to schedule a hearing in order to address: (1) the merits of Heath’s petition which might require further briefing given the unavailability of Hudspeth’s affidavit and the State’s lack of opportunity to file a response based on that affidavit; and (2) whether Heath should be assigned new counsel given that Avery would be a potential witness regarding conversations with Hudspeth about issues germane to Heath’s petition.</p>
    <p id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[106,1395,1326,333]]]'>¶10 Heath’s motion also asserted that Hudspeth’s death placed the parties and the court in an “unusual posture.” Heath sought guidance from the District Court on how to proceed. Heath’s motion further notified the District Court that he intended to file an amendment to his petition that would add two or more contentions of ineffective assistance of counsel. Heath stated that he would await directions from the District Court to file that pleading.</p>
    <p id="b385-7" data-blocks='[["BL_385.7",385,[104,1736,1327,377]]]'>¶11 The District Court did not grant Heath’s request for a hearing or respond to his motion for guidance. Avery removed himself voluntarily from the case based on the potential that the District Court would call him as a witness at a potential hearing. The State responded to Heath’s petition. Heath’s new appellate counsel filed a reply to the State’s response. Heath’s reply renewed his request for a hearing based on the petition and Hudspeth’s failure to comply with the District Court’s order to file an affidavit.</p>
    <p id="b385-8" data-blocks='[["BL_385.8",385,[104,2128,1325,188]]]'>¶12 The District Court granted Heath’s petition to the limited extent that it eliminated his restitution obligation.

Lewis, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2007%20MT%2016" class="citation" data-index="46">2007 MT 16</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=335%20Mont.%20331" class="citation" data-index="47">335 Mont. 331</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=151%20P.3d%20883" class="citation" data-index="48">151 P.3d 883</a>. We noted that post-conviction proceedings provide a better forum to resolve these claims so that the trial court may “explore fully” counsel’s decisions. <em>Lewis, </em>¶ 21.</p>
    <p id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[176,1792,1328,576]],["BL_389.1",389,[100,327,1323,88]]]'>¶24 Hudspeth’s death before he had filed the court-ordered response constitutes “unique circumstances.” <em>Herman, </em>¶ 50. The record in this case fails to set forth Hudspeth’s reasons for his pre-trial actions and his trial decisions. <em>Soraich, </em>¶ 24. Only Heath and Hudspeth witnessed many of the events upon which Heath based his allegations. The District Court’s denial of an evidentiary hearing, in the absence of Hudspeth’s court-ordered response, denied Heath any alternative means of inquiry into Hudspeth’s reasons for his actions and decisions. The District Court did not “explore fully” why Hudspeth made his decisions. <em>Lewis, </em>¶ 21. Hudspeth’s untimely death and failure to file the court-ordered response to Heath’s allegations should not result in an insurmountable barrier to Heath’s attempt to obtain the <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>information, necessary to meet his <em>Strickland </em>burden. <em>Dawson, </em>¶ 20; <em>Strickland, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=466%20U.S.%20668" class="citation" data-index="49">466 U.S. at 687</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=104%20S.%20Ct.%202052" class="citation" data-index="50">104 S.

    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[99,426,1325,531]]]'>¶25 The District Court deemed a number of Hudspeth’s decisions not to call certain witnesses to be strategic or tactical decisions. The District Court stated conclusively that tactical decisions are not grounds for inadequate assistance claims. Without Hudspeth’s answers and absent an evidentiary hearing, however, the District Court’s conclusions as to why Hudspeth made his decisions amount to pure speculation. <em>Soraich, </em>¶ 24. We recently clarified that “rigid classification of counsel’s performance as strategic/tactical... does not render it immune from attack.” <em>Whitlow v. State, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2008%20MT%20140" class="citation" data-index="51">2008 MT 140</a>, ¶ 19, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=343%20Mont.%2090" class="citation" data-index="52">343 Mont. 90</a>, ¶ 19, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=183%20P.3d%20861" class="citation" data-index="53">183 P.3d 861</a>, ¶ 19. Counsel’s performance must follow a <em>“reasonable </em>strategy.” <em>Whitlow, </em>¶ 19.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[98,966,1330,431]]]'>¶26 The District Court also failed entirely to address a number of Heath’s claims of inadequate assistance of counsel. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing in <em>Williams v. State, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2002%20MT%20189" class="citation" data-index="54">2002 MT 189</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=311%20Mont.%20108" class="citation" data-index="55">311 Mont. 108</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=53%20P.3d%20864" class="citation" data-index="56">53 P.3d 864</a>, where the district court’s order failed to address all of the petitioner’s inadequate assistance claims. We stated that it was “unclear,” based on the district court’s order, whether the court “even considered Williams’ additional claims.” <em>Williams, </em>¶ 26. Heath likewise is entitled to have his additional issues “independently considered.” <em>Williams, </em>¶ 27.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[97,1409,1329,668]]]'>¶27  The State correctly argues that a petition for post-conviction relief should not serve as a broad discovery device. <em>Smith v. State, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2000%20MT%20327" class="citation" data-index="57">2000 MT 327</a>, ¶ 28, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=303%20Mont.%2047" class="citation" data-index="58">303 Mont. 47</a>, ¶ 28, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=15%20P.3d%20395" class="citation" data-index="59">15 P.3d 395</a>, ¶ 28. The petitioner may not conduct a “fishing expedition” in an attempt to establish the right to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Smith, </em>¶ 28. The “unique circumstances” present here, however, require that the District Court provide Heath reasonable alternative means, including an evidentiary hearing and access to Hudspeth’s records, if available, to inquire into Hudspeth’s reasons for his decisions. <em>Herman, </em>¶ 50; <em>Soraich, </em>¶ 24. The District Court abused its discretion when it denied Heath’s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing and without considering all of his claims. <em>Morgan, </em>¶ 7. The hearing also will allow the District Court, in the first instance, to evaluate the merits of Heath’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
