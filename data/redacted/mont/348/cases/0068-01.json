We affirm.\n\u00b62 St. James raises two issues on appeal, both of which go to the merits of the case. The only issue properly before this Court, however, is the propriety of the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court. Accordingly, we state the issue on appeal as follows:\n\u00b63 Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion when it granted Dr. Cole a preliminary injunction against St. James?\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b64 St. James Healthcare is a not-for-profit corporation that operates a hospital in Butte. Dr. Jesse Cole has been a member of the Medical Staff at St. James since 1996. The St. James Healthcare Medical Staff Bylaws (\u201cthe Bylaws\u201d) require Medical Staff members to apply for reappointment every two years. In 2006, Dr. Cole applied for reappointment. Later that year, St. James obtained a permanent injunction against Dr. Cole, to enjoin him from threatening hospital staff and from contacting potential candidates for the hospital\u2019s radiology department. St. James Healthcare v. Cole, 2008 MT 44, 341 Mont. 368, 178 P.3d 696.\n\u00b65 In a letter dated December 21, 2006, Dr. Sharon Hecker, the Chair of St. James\u2019s Board of Directors, notified Dr. Cole that the Board had \u201cserious concerns regarding [Dr. Cole\u2019s] professional relationship with other healthcare providers, staff and patients.\u201d Hecker also informed Dr. Cole that, effective immediately, Dr. Cole\u2019s status as a staff member was changed from \u201cactive\u201d to \u201cconsulting.\u201d St. James did not give Dr. Cole any advance notice of this status change, and denied his request to appeal this decision. Before the Board could make a decision on Dr. Cole\u2019s application for reappointment, Hecker wrote, it needed \u201cadditional information.\u201d\n\u00b66 The Board hired an attorney, Carey Matovich, to conduct an independent investigation (hereinafter \u201cMatovich investigation\u201d). Dr. Cole refused to cooperate with Matovich, because he believed that under Article VII, Part C, he was entitled to an investigation conducted by his peers on the Medical Staff. At the close of her investigation, Matovich recommended that the Board deny Dr. Cole\u2019s application for reappointment. The Board then issued a preliminary decision denying Dr. Cole\u2019s reappointment. The Board notified Dr. Cole of its preliminary decision, and offered him the opportunity to challenge the decision through the hearing and appeals process set forth in Article VIII of the Bylaws.\n\u00b67 Dr. Cole chose to exercise his right to appeal the preliminary decision, but before a hearing could be held, Dr. Cole filed this complaint against St. James. Dr. Cole alleged that the Bylaws constituted an enforceable contract between the parties. Dr. Cole claimed that St. James violated these Bylaws and breached their contract.\n\u00b68 Dr. Cole also applied for a preliminary injunction, to prevent St. James from taking further adverse action against him, and from making a detrimental report to the National Practitioner\u2019s Database. Dr. Cole also asked the court to order St. James to restore his active staff privileges. Both parties presented evidence at a show cause hearing. The District Court granted the preliminary injunction, and issued the following order:\n1. The Defendant is enjoined from refusing to consider Dr. Jesse A. Cole to have full active staff privileges at St. James Healthcare, and is ordered to reinstate Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges to the status of full active staff privileges;\n2. The Defendant is enjoined from adopting the recommendation of the Matovich investigation not to renew Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges at St. James Healthcare, as such investigation and recommendation did not involve peer review as contemplated by the Hospital Bylaws;\n3. The Defendant is enjoined from making any adverse report to the National Practitioner Data Bank regarding the Hospital\u2019s reduction of Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges; and\n4. The Defendant is enjoined from taking any further adverse action against Dr. Cole\u2019s full active staff privileges unless and until the Hospital utilizes a peer review investigation conducted by its Medical Staff as required by the Hospital\u2019s Bylaws.\nSt. James appeals the court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b69 District courts are vested with a high degree of discretion to maintain the status quo through injunctive relief. Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., 2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 912, \u00b6 12. Accordingly, we refuse to disturb a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction unless a manifest abuse of discretion has been shown. Sweet Grass Farms v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, 2000 MT 147, \u00b6 20, 300 Mont. 66, \u00b6 20, 2 P.3d 825, \u00b6 20. A manifest abuse of discretion is \u201cone that is obvious, evident or unmistakable.\u201d Shammel, \u00b6 12. We employ this standard of review in reviewing both mandatory and prohibitive injunctions. City of Whitefish v. Troy Town Pump, Inc., 2001 MT 58, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 346, \u00b6 21, 21 P.3d 1026, \u00b6 21. Where the district court issues an injunction based on conclusions of law, we review those conclusions for correctness. St. James Healthcare, \u00b6 21.\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b610 Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion when it granted Dr. Cole a preliminary injunction against St. James?\n\u00b611 Section 27-19-201, MCA, provides (in relevant part) that a district court may issue a preliminary injunction under the following circumstances:\n(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;\n(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant; [or]\n(3) when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act in violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.]\nSection 27-19-201(1) - (3), MCA (subsections (4) and (5) omitted).\n\u00b612 On appeal, St. James fails to address the individual prongs of this statute. Instead, St. James asks us to determine whether the Board complied with its Bylaws in denying Dr. Cole\u2019s application for reappointment, and whether the Matovich investigation is privileged from discovery under \u00a7 37-2-201, MCA, and \u00a7 50-16-201, MCA. Neither issue is properly before this Court for review.\n\u00b613 When weighing the merits of a preliminary injunction, \u201c[i]t is not the province of either the District Court or the Supreme Court on appeal to determine finally matters that may arise upon a trial on the merits.\u201d Sweet Grass, \u00b6 38 (citing Dreyer v. Board of Trustees, 193 Mont. 95, 100, 630 P.2d 226, 229 (1981)). By granting temporary injunctive relief, courts \u201cshould in no manner anticipate the ultimate determination of the questions of right involved.\u201d Sweet Grass, \u00b6 38 (citing Porter v. K & S Partnership, 192 Mont. 175, 183, 627 P.2d 836, 840 (1981)). In sum, our task in reviewing the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the preliminary injunction against St. James is \u201cnot to resolve the substantive matters of law relevant to the ultimate resolution of [the] complaint;\u201d it is to inquire only whether the District Court manifestly abused its discretion by granting the injunction. Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, 2006 MT 254, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 86, \u00b6 19, 146 P.3d 714, \u00b6 19.\n\u00b614 The District Court concluded that Dr. Cole\u2019s application met the requirements of \u00a7 27-19-201(1), (2), and (3), MCA, and thus, that a preliminary injunction was appropriate. We have held, however, that the five factors of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, are disjunctive: the moving party must satisfy only one of these factors in order to prevail. Sweet Grass, \u00b6 27. We turn first to \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA.\n\u00b615 Section 27-19-201(1), MCA, provides that a preliminary injunction may issue when an applicant has demonstrated that he is entitled to the injunctive relief he has requested. To prevail under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA, an applicant must establish that he has a legitimate cause of action, and that he is likely to succeed on the merits of that claim. Benefis, \u00b6 22; M. H. v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n, 280 Mont. 123, 135, 929 P.2d 239, 247 (1996). Implicit in a court\u2019s decision to issue an injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA, is the finding that an injunction is, in fact, an appropriate remedy.\n\u00b6 16 As a preliminary matter, the District Court concluded that the Bylaws constituted a contract between Cole and St. James. Neither party appeals that conclusion. Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, we assume that a contract exists between the two parties.\n\u00b617 At the show cause hearing, Dr. Cole contended that St. James breached by changing his staff status from \u201cactive\u201d to \u201cconsulting\u201d without giving him the three month notice required by Article VII, Part A, Section 3 of the Bylaws. Dr. Cole argued that under Article VIII of the Bylaws, he was entitled to appeal this decision. St. James disagreed, and denied his request for an appeal. This, Dr. Cole claimed, constituted another breach of contract.\n\u00b618 The District Court agreed that these actions constituted an apparent breach, and found:\n1) Dr. Cole did not receive the three-month notice that his privileges would be reduced or not renewed before the Hospital took such action, as required by Article VII, Part A, Section 3(a) [and] (b) of the Bylaws.\n2) Dr. Cole\u2019s request for a hearing and an appeal when his privileges were reduced or altered was denied, in violation of Article VII, Part A, Section 5(c) and Article VIII, Part B, Section 1 of the Bylaws.\nOn appeal, St. James does not challenge these findings. Thus, we cannot say that the District Court erred in concluding that Dr. Cole was likely to succeed on the merits of his breach of contract claim with respect to these issues.\n\u00b619 At the show cause hearing, Dr. Cole also argued that St. James failed to comply with the Bylaws when processing his application for reappointment to the Medical Staff. Specifically, Dr. Cole claimed that St. James violated the Bylaws by appointing Matovich to investigate the allegations of misconduct against him. Instead, Dr. Cole maintained, St. James should have made a written request for an investigation to the President of the Medical Staff, Dr. Popovich. Under Article VIII, Part C of the Bylaws, the President would then appoint an internal investigating committee made up of Dr. Cole\u2019s peers. Dr. Cole contended that St. James breached by failing to follow the procedures set forth in Article VIII, Part C of the Bylaws.\n\u00b620 Once again, the District Court concluded that St. James\u2019s actions constituted an apparent breach of contract, and made the following findings:\n3) When the Hospital advised Dr. Cole of its concerns regarding his conduct toward other Medical Staff members, neither the Hospital CEO nor the Chairperson of the Hospital Board made a written request for an investigation of the matter to the President of the Medical Staff, contrary to Article VII, Part C, Section 1 of the Bylaws.\n4) The investigation conducted by the Hospital, which resulted in a recommendation that Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges not be renewed, did not involve the President of the Medical Staff, the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff, an Ad Hoc committee of the Medical Staff, or an Investigating Committee of the Medical Staff comprised of up to three (3) persons all holding appointment to the Medical Staff, as required by Article VII, Part C, Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Bylaws.\n5) Attorney Carey Matovich is not a member of the Medical Staff. She is not a peer of Dr. Cole. She was hired by the Hospital\u2019s Board of Directors, not by the Medical Staff Executive Committee or any other peer investigating committee. The Matovich investigation and recommendation on behalf of the Hospital was not peer review as defined in Article 1(11) of the Bylaws, and did not comply with the peer review investigation and recommendation procedures required by Article VII of the Bylaws.\n\u00b621 On appeal, St. James argues that the District Court misinterpreted the Bylaws, and asks this Court to decide whether or not it complied with the Bylaws in handling Dr. Cole\u2019s application for re-appointment. This issue goes to the heart of Dr. Cole\u2019s breach of contract claim; again, we do not reach the merits of the ultimate legal questions when reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction. Sweet Grass, \u00b6 38.\n\u00b622 Under the manifest abuse of discretion standard, we give great deference to a district court\u2019s findings of fact in reviewing the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. Shammel, \u00b6 12. Based on the evidence produced by Dr. Cole at the show cause hearing, the District Court concluded that Dr. Cole was likely to succeed on the merits of his breach of contract claim. St. James has not challenged these findings, nor have they shown that the issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted an \u201cobvious, evident or unmistakable\u201d abuse of discretion. Shammel, \u00b6 12.\n\u00b623 Finally, we turn to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that an injunction was an appropriate remedy in the instant case. The District Court concluded that if Dr. Cole were denied the preliminary injunction, and St. James continued its alleged breach, Dr. Cole would suffer irreparable injury. Specifically, the court found that as a result of St. James\u2019s apparent breach, there was a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that St. James would issue an adverse report regarding Dr. Cole to the National Practitioner\u2019s Data Bank (\u201cNPDB\u201d). The District Court analogized an adverse report to \u201ca \u2018scarlet letter\u2019 that could permanently harm a physician\u2019s professional reputation.\u201d As a result, the court concluded, \u201csuch conduct by the Hospital would render a successful judgment in favor of Dr. Cole ineffectual and meaningless.\u201d Thus, the court held, a money judgment could not adequately address Dr. Cole\u2019s alleged injuries.\n\u00b624 In response, St. James argues that no adverse report would be made to NPDB until after Dr. Cole has appealed the Board\u2019s decision denying him reappointment - a process that would take at least several months. As part of the appeals process under Article VIII of the Bylaws, the Board\u2019s decision would undergo peer review by the Medical Staff. Thus, St. James contends, there is little chance that an erroneous adverse report would be made. In sum, St. James asserts, Dr. Cole did not and does not face any imminent injury.\n\u00b625 The purpose of preliminary injunctive relief is to maintain the status quo pending the final outcome of the litigation. We have defined \u201cstatus quo\u201d as \u201cthe last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.\u201d Benefis, \u00b6 14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, \u201cit is the court\u2019s duty to minimize the injury or damage to all parties to the controversy.\u201d Benefis, \u00b6 14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Dr. Cole challenged the process by which St. James changed his staff status, investigated allegations of misconduct against him, and denied his application for reappointment. If Dr. Cole is correct, and St. James has breached the Bylaws, the effects of the breach on Dr. Cole\u2019s reputation could be permanent. The District Court restored Dr. Cole to his status as an active staff member, restrained St. James from adopting the recommendation of the challenged Matovich investigation, and from taking any further adverse action on Dr. Cole\u2019s application. The court\u2019s injunction protects both Dr. Cole\u2019s patients and his professional reputation, at a minimal cost to St. James. The preliminary injunction issued by the District Court appropriately minimized injury to both parties in the case, and preserved the status quo pending the final resolution of this litigation.\n\u00b626 We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Dr. Cole was eligible for a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA. As discussed above, the requirements of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, are disjunctive: the moving party must satisfy only one of these factors in order to prevail. Sweet Grass, \u00b6 27. Since we have concluded that a preliminary injunction was appropriate under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA, we need not reach the remaining two subsections discussed by the District Court.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b627 In sum, we conclude that St. James has failed to demonstrate that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion by issuing the preliminary injunction. The District Court correctly concluded that Dr. Cole\u2019s application for the preliminary injunction satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA. Affirmed.\nJUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.", "type": "majority", "author": "JUSTICE LEAPHART"}, {"text": "JUSTICE RICE,\ndissenting.\n\u00b628 I believe that the District Court made significant errors in determining to issue the preliminary injunction and that St. James\u2019s arguments on appeal are not given entirely fair consideration.\n\u00b629 The District Court waded deeply into the merits of this dispute, analyzing the facts and the law. It decided that the Bylaws constituted a contract between the parties (\u201cThe Court finds that the elements of a contract are met in this case\u201d). It interpreted the contract (\u201cthat procedure [under Article VI, Part C, Section 4(b)] does not constitute peer review. Rather, the procedure for valid \u2018peer review investigation\u2019 and \u2018peer review recommendation\u2019 is set forth in Article VII\u201d). It then determined that St. James had breached and was continuing to breach the contract (\u201cBased on the record before it, the Court finds the Matovich investigation and resulting recommendation regarding Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges was not peer review.... the Court finds that the Hospital apparently has breached, and continues to breach, the contract between Dr. Cole and the Hospital, as created by the Bylaws.\u201d).\n\u00b630 We have held that courts are not to reach the merits of a dispute when determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, and admonished the courts not to do so. \u201cIt was inappropriate for the District Court to make such conclusions at this stage of the proceedings, and we implore trial courts ... to be careful not to resolve ultimate issues of the case.\u201d Benefis, \u00b6 32. Days ago, we were faced with the same error in City of Whitefish v. Board of County Commissioners, 2008 MT 436, 347 Mont. 490, 199 P.3d 201, noting that \u201cthe [district] court not only anticipated the ultimate determination of the validity of the Agreement, it made the determination outright... This was error.\u201d \u00b6 18. We turned back the improperly entered conclusions in City of Whitefish so that they could be determined at trial. I would do the same thing here. After rolling back the improperly entered conclusions, I would consider whether a preliminary injunction should be issued in this case under the correct analysis. City of Whitefish, \u00b6 19.\n\u00b631 Generally, \u201c[a]n applicant for a preliminary injunction must establish a prima facie case, or show that it is at least doubtful whether or not he will suffer irreparable injury before his rights can be fully litigated.\u201d Benefis, \u00b6 14. The District Court concluded that Dr. Cole had established a prima facie case, or demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, based upon the improperly entered conclusions, addressed above. Beyond that error, however, I believe the proper, preliminary analysis of the Bylaws necessary to determine whether Dr. Cole had a likelihood of success on the merits demonstrates that the District Court\u2019s approach was significantly flawed. I agree with St. James that the District Court looked to the wrong provisions of the Bylaws in determining what procedures would be required following denial of Dr. Cole\u2019s reappointment application-a critical misstep in assessing the likelihood of success on the merits. Looking at the correct provisions raises a serious question over whether a breach of contract warranting an injunction can be established.\n\u00b632 The Bylaws are laid out as follows: Article VI addresses appointment to the Medical Staff generally, Article VII addresses \u201cActions Affecting Medical Staff Members,\u201d and Article VIII addresses \u201cHearing and Appeal Procedures.\u201d Article VII, governing actions affecting medical staff, is further broken into parts that address different situations and the procedures applicable thereto: Part A provides the \u201cProcedure for Reappointment,\u201d Part B provides \u201cProcedures for Requesting Increase in Clinical Privileges,\u201d Part C provides \u201cProcedure for Other Questions Involving Medical Staff Members,\u201d Part D addresses \u201cSummary Suspension of Clinical Privileges,\u201d and Part E addresses \u201cOther Actions.\u201d On the face of these provisions, it appears that Part A should govern this matter, as it specifically addresses, as its title indicates, \u201cProcedures for Reappointment.\u201d\n\u00b633 Nonetheless, the District Court concluded that the procedures in Part C of Article VII, which generally govern \u201cOther Questions Involving Medical Staff,\u201d control this matter. However, requiring St. James to follow the procedures in Part C for a reappointment application could obviate the reason for Part A\u2019s existence. Under the District Court\u2019s interpretation, the procedures set forth in Part A could be rendered meaningless, potentially subsumed within the more general provisions of Part C. Part C is written broadly and applies \u201cwhenever ... [various St. James authorities] has cause to question\u201d a variety of problems with a medical staff member. It appears from a preliminary review that Part C is intended to apply when an authority has cause to question a doctor\u2019s fitness outside of the reappointment application process. The District Court provided no reason why Part C should be applied instead of Part A, at least with regard to the reappointment issue. The specific provisions therein of the procedure to be followed when \u201cthe Board determines to reject the favorable recommendations of the Executive Committee\u201d regarding reappointments seem particularly applicable.\n\u00b634 The District Court got sidetracked in its extensive discussion about whether the actions undertaken by St. James were properly considered \u201cpeer review.\u201d However, the initial question which should have been considered was whether peer review was even required under the applicable Bylaws at this stage, which I seriously question. Article VII, Part A, and Article VI, Part C, appear to grant powers to the Board to discuss an appointment issue with the Executive Committee Chairperson, refer the matter to the Committee for further investigation, and consult with third parties about the applicant. I cannot see that Dr. Cole has established a prima facie case that the Board\u2019s actions in hiring Matovich and proceeding exceed the powers granted it under the Bylaws. See Article VI, Part C, Section 4(b). Then, after the Board makes its decision pursuant to these provisions, Dr. Cole can pursue an appeal, and peer review can come into play.\n\u00b635 The Court declines to consider St. James\u2019s likelihood of success arguments. On the one hand, the Court says in \u00b6 22 that St. James \u201chas not challenged these findings\u201d of the District Court regarding Dr. Cole\u2019s success on the merits. However, the District Court\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d quoted by the Court in \u00b6\u00b6 18 and 20 include conclusions of law about the governing provisions of the Bylaws, which St. James indeed contests. Then, on the other hand, the Court in \u00b6 21 dismisses St. James\u2019s arguments because \u201cwe do not reach the merits of the ultimate legal questions....\u201d The Court thus reaches its decision without consideration of St. James\u2019s arguments. Somewhere between the conclusion that St. James has not challenged the District Court\u2019s determination on likelihood of success on the merits, and the refusal to consider St. James\u2019s arguments because they go to the merits, St. James\u2019s arguments have completely vanished. Although St. James\u2019s arguments may go too far by touching on ultimate interpretational issues, we should remember that the District Court went even further. St. James argues that the District Court went so far as to harm the Hospital\u2019s case on the merits. I agree with that concern, and I believe we can entertain St. James\u2019s arguments as a proper challenge to the District Court\u2019s analysis of the likelihood of success on the merits, and properly consider them for that purpose.\n\u00b636 The Court concludes in \u00b6 26 that Dr. Cole established a basis for issuance of an injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA. That section addresses likelihood of success on the merits, and for the reasons expressed above, I would disagree. I also agree with St. James\u2019s arguments regarding the likelihood of irreparable harm. St. James has not contested for purposes of this appeal that it erred by the manner in which it reduced Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges from active staff to consulting staff, and has reinstated Dr. Cole\u2019s privileges pending continuation of the process under the Bylaws. This action preserves the status quo, insuring that Dr. Cole will retain his current privileges during an appeal and peer review as provided by the Bylaws. St. James\u2019s position on Dr. Cole\u2019s status and its explanation that no adverse reports about Dr. Cole will be issued until the appeal process and peer review have been completed obviate any need to issue an injunction. The only reason for issuance of the injunction now is to prevent the possibility \u201cthat an erroneous adverse report\u201d may be made. Opinion, \u00b6 24. However, it is clear that such a remote possibility does not establish a \u201clikelihood\u201d that Dr. Cole will be irreparably harmed.\n\u00b637 The District Court made substantial errors in its analysis. On their face, the Bylaws contain provisions requiring a different procedure for reappointments than recognized by the District Court, which undermine the claim of likelihood of success on the merits. At present, there is little or no likelihood of irreparable harm. I would conclude that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion and reverse those portions of the injunction order challenged on appeal by St. James.\nJUSTICE COTTER joining in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.", "type": "dissent", "author": "JUSTICE RICE,"}], "attorneys": ["For Appellant: Robert F.
