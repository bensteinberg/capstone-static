STATE OF MONTANA, Respondent and Appellee."], "opinions": [{"text": "JUSTICE MORRIS\ndelivered the Opinion of the Court.\n\u00b61 Barry Alonzo Heath (Heath) appeals an order of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County. The order partially denied Heath\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.\n\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:\n\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Heath\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without granting him an evidentiary hearing?\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\u00b64 The State charged Heath on February 27,2001, with one count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent. The State amended its information on May 7, 2001, to include a count of Tampering with a Witness. A jury convicted Heath of both counts on March 11, 2002. Steven Hudspeth (Hudspeth) represented Heath for the maj ority of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. Hudspeth withdrew as Heath\u2019s attorney of record after Heath\u2019s conviction and first sentencing.\n\u00b65 This Court affirmed Heath\u2019s convictions, but reversed his sentence and remanded the case back to the District Court for resentencing. State v. Heath, 2004 MT 58, 320 Mont. 211, 89 P.3d 947. The District Court re-sentenced Heath on March 21, 2004. Heath appealed his new sentence and we denied his appeal. State v. Heath, 2005 MT 280, 329 Mont. 226, 123 P.3d 228.\n\u00b66 Heath timely filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the District Court on February 7, 2007. Heath alleged that Hudspeth had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Heath also claimed that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to raise a restitution issue on direct appeal.\n\u00b67 David Avery (Avery) served as Heath\u2019s initial counsel for post-conviction purposes. Avery requested that Hudspeth answer Heath\u2019s allegations through an affidavit to be attached as an exhibit to Heath\u2019s petition. Hudspeth declined. Hudspeth instead stated that he would answer the petition\u2019s assertions at a hearing. Heath\u2019s petition therefore requested that the District Court hold a hearing. Heath\u2019s petition further requested the District Court to order the State to respond to Heath\u2019s petition and to allow Heath to reply to the State\u2019s response, \u201c[i]n the interests of clarifying the issues to be addressed at such a hearing.\u201d\n\u00b68 The State moved the District Court for an order directing Hudspeth to respond within 20 days to the charges in Heath\u2019s petition. The State filed its motion pursuant to In re Petition of Gillham, 216 Mont. 279, 282, 704 P.2d 1019, 1021 (1985), on the ground that \u201ca response from counsel is necessary in order to answer the charges of ineffective assistance.\u201d The District Court, upon considering the State\u2019s motion \u201cand good cause appearing therefrom,\u201d ordered Hudspeth to respond by affidavit to the specific charges of ineffective assistance of counsel within 20 days. Hudspeth shortly thereafter took his own life without having filed the affidavit ordered by the District Court.\n\u00b69 Heath filed a Motion for Hearing and Guidance from the Court. Heath requested the District Court to schedule a hearing in order to address: (1) the merits of Heath\u2019s petition which might require further briefing given the unavailability of Hudspeth\u2019s affidavit and the State\u2019s lack of opportunity to file a response based on that affidavit; and (2) whether Heath should be assigned new counsel given that Avery would be a potential witness regarding conversations with Hudspeth about issues germane to Heath\u2019s petition.\n\u00b610 Heath\u2019s motion also asserted that Hudspeth\u2019s death placed the parties and the court in an \u201cunusual posture.\u201d Heath sought guidance from the District Court on how to proceed. Heath\u2019s motion further notified the District Court that he intended to file an amendment to his petition that would add two or more contentions of ineffective assistance of counsel. Heath stated that he would await directions from the District Court to file that pleading.\n\u00b611 The District Court did not grant Heath\u2019s request for a hearing or respond to his motion for guidance. Avery removed himself voluntarily from the case based on the potential that the District Court would call him as a witness at a potential hearing. The State responded to Heath\u2019s petition. Heath\u2019s new appellate counsel filed a reply to the State\u2019s response. Heath\u2019s reply renewed his request for a hearing based on the petition and Hudspeth\u2019s failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order to file an affidavit.\n\u00b612 The District Court granted Heath\u2019s petition to the limited extent that it eliminated his restitution obligation. The District Court denied the remainder of Heath\u2019s petition and denied his request for an evidentiary hearing. Heath appeals.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. Jordan v. State, 2007 MT 165, \u00b6 5, 338 Mont. 113, \u00b6 5, 162 P.3d 863, \u00b6 5. We review discretionary rulings in post-conviction relief proceedings, including rulings related to whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, for an abuse of discretion. State v. Morgan, 2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 7, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 7. We review de novo the mixed questions of law and fact presented by claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Weaver v. State, 2005 MT 158, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 441, \u00b6 13, 114 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 13.\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b614 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Heath\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without granting him an evidentiary hearing?\n\u00b615 Heath argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing. Heath contends that due to the unique circumstances, he deserves a new trial, or, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing on his petition. The State argues that the District Court properly dismissed Heath\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.\n\u00b616 A person requesting post-conviction relief must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts justify the relief. State v. Cobell, 2004 MT 46, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 122, \u00b6 12, 86 P.3d 20, \u00b6 12. A petition for post-conviction relief must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. A court may dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing if the petition fails to satisfy the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. Herman v. State, 2006 MT 7, \u00b6 15,330 Mont. 267, \u00b6 15, 127 P.3d 422, \u00b6 15. A district court also may dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief without ordering a response if the petition, files and records \u201cconclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Alternatively, a district court may order a response and, after reviewing the response, \u201cdismiss the petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief or it may proceed to determine the issue.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA; Herman, \u00b6 15.\n\u00b617 The reviewing court must apply the two-prong test from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), in assessing claims of inadequate assistance of counsel. Dawson v. State, 2000 MT 219, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 20, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 20. Under the Strickland standard, a defendant must establish that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Dawson, \u00b6 20; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. The defendant must demonstrate that a reasonable probability exists that, \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Dawson, \u00b6 20; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.\n\u00b618 Heath\u2019s petition alleged \u201cmany instances\u201d of Hudspeth\u2019s ineffective representation that deprived him of a fair trial, including: 1) a failure to investigate, interview or call at trial witnesses that Heath contends would have been helpful to his case; 2) a failure to investigate physical evidence; 3) a failure to follow through with certain trial tactics Hudspeth had told Heath that he would perform; 4) misrepresenting Heath\u2019s chances at trial; and 5) Hudspeth\u2019s failure to meet with Heath or return Heath\u2019s calls before trial. Heath attached his own affidavit to the petition, and requested that Hudspeth also respond to the allegations in an affidavit. After Hudspeth\u2019s death, Heath informed the District Court in his Motion for Hearing and Guidance from the Court that he intended to file additional inadequate assistance claims after he received guidance from the court due to the unusual circumstances.\n\u00b619 The State moved the District Court to compel Hudspeth to answer Heath\u2019s allegations. The State asserted that a response from Hudspeth was \u201cnecessary\u201d to resolve the allegation of inadequate assistance. The District Court could have dismissed Heath\u2019s petition based on the record without ordering a response if it had found conclusively that Heath\u2019s claims did not have merit. Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA; Herman, \u00b6 15. Instead, finding \u201cgood cause\u201d in the State\u2019s request, the District Court ordered Hudspeth to explain in an affidavit his pre-trial and trial decisions.\n\u00b620 After Hudspeth\u2019s death, the District Court reviewed only Heath\u2019s petition and affidavit, the State\u2019s response, and Heath\u2019s reply. The District Court denied Heath\u2019s petition without holding a hearing. The District Court stated that it failed to see the benefit of a hearing without Hudspeth in attendance.\n\u00b621 Not all circumstances require the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on a petition for post-conviction relief. See Cobell, \u00b6 12; Griffin v. State, 2003 MT 267, \u00b6 12, 317 Mont. 457, \u00b6 12, 77 P.3d 545, \u00b6 12. In certain settings, however, especially those with \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d we have remanded a petition for post-conviction relief for an evidentiary hearing. Herman, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51 (citing State v. Schaff, 2001 MT 130, 305 Mont. 427, 28 P.3d 1073; State v. Lawrence, 2001 MT 299, 307 Mont. 487, 38 P.3d 809).\n\u00b622 In Soraich v. State, 2002 MT 187, 311 Mont. 90, 53 P.3d 878, for example, we remanded for an evidentiary hearing because the record failed to set forth counsel\u2019s reasons for his decisions. We described as \u201cpurely speculative\u201d the district court\u2019s \u201cguesses\u201d as to what had led to counsel\u2019s failure to call certain witnesses. Soraich, \u00b6 24. We cited State v. Bromgard, 273 Mont. 20, 24, 901 P.2d 611, 614, where, noting the lack of any factual record, we stated that \u201cissues of this nature are best resolved after an evidentiary proceeding in the district court.\u201d Soraich, \u00b6 25.\n\u00b623 In Schaff, the petitioner alleged that his plea had not been voluntary because counsel had misled him into believing that, despite his desire for new counsel and potential entitlement to new counsel, he was required to proceed with current counsel. Schaff, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing to permit the petitioner to present any nonrecord based ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Schaff, \u00b6 10. We likewise remanded for an evidentiary hearing in Lawrence where the petitioner claimed on appeal that her counsel knew in advance that the court was not going to follow the sentencing recommendation in her proposed plea agreement and had failed to advise her. Lawrence, \u00b6 11. We followed our usual course of dismissing nonrecord based claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal in State v. Lewis, 2007 MT 16, 335 Mont. 331, 151 P.3d 883. We noted that post-conviction proceedings provide a better forum to resolve these claims so that the trial court may \u201cexplore fully\u201d counsel\u2019s decisions. Lewis, \u00b6 21.\n\u00b624 Hudspeth\u2019s death before he had filed the court-ordered response constitutes \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d Herman, \u00b6 50. The record in this case fails to set forth Hudspeth\u2019s reasons for his pre-trial actions and his trial decisions. Soraich, \u00b6 24. Only Heath and Hudspeth witnessed many of the events upon which Heath based his allegations. The District Court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing, in the absence of Hudspeth\u2019s court-ordered response, denied Heath any alternative means of inquiry into Hudspeth\u2019s reasons for his actions and decisions. The District Court did not \u201cexplore fully\u201d why Hudspeth made his decisions. Lewis, \u00b6 21. Hudspeth\u2019s untimely death and failure to file the court-ordered response to Heath\u2019s allegations should not result in an insurmountable barrier to Heath\u2019s attempt to obtain the information, necessary to meet his Strickland burden. Dawson, \u00b6 20; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064.\n\u00b625 The District Court deemed a number of Hudspeth\u2019s decisions not to call certain witnesses to be strategic or tactical decisions. The District Court stated conclusively that tactical decisions are not grounds for inadequate assistance claims. Without Hudspeth\u2019s answers and absent an evidentiary hearing, however, the District Court\u2019s conclusions as to why Hudspeth made his decisions amount to pure speculation. Soraich, \u00b6 24. We recently clarified that \u201crigid classification of counsel\u2019s performance as strategic/tactical... does not render it immune from attack.\u201d Whitlow v. State, 2008 MT 140, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 19, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 19. Counsel\u2019s performance must follow a \u201creasonable strategy.\u201d Whitlow, \u00b6 19.\n\u00b626 The District Court also failed entirely to address a number of Heath\u2019s claims of inadequate assistance of counsel. We remanded for an evidentiary hearing in Williams v. State, 2002 MT 189, 311 Mont. 108, 53 P.3d 864, where the district court\u2019s order failed to address all of the petitioner\u2019s inadequate assistance claims. We stated that it was \u201cunclear,\u201d based on the district court\u2019s order, whether the court \u201ceven considered Williams\u2019 additional claims.\u201d Williams, \u00b6 26. Heath likewise is entitled to have his additional issues \u201cindependently considered.\u201d Williams, \u00b6 27.\n\u00b627 The State correctly argues that a petition for post-conviction relief should not serve as a broad discovery device. Smith v. State, 2000 MT 327, \u00b6 28, 303 Mont. 47, \u00b6 28, 15 P.3d 395, \u00b6 28. The petitioner may not conduct a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d in an attempt to establish the right to an evidentiary hearing. Smith, \u00b6 28. The \u201cunique circumstances\u201d present here, however, require that the District Court provide Heath reasonable alternative means, including an evidentiary hearing and access to Hudspeth\u2019s records, if available, to inquire into Hudspeth\u2019s reasons for his decisions. Herman, \u00b6 50; Soraich, \u00b6 24. The District Court abused its discretion when it denied Heath\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing and without considering all of his claims. Morgan, \u00b6 7. The hearing also will allow the District Court, in the first instance, to evaluate the merits of Heath\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u00b628 Reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.\nJUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and NELSON concur.", "type": "majority", "author": "JUSTICE MORRIS"}], "attorneys": ["For Appellant: Colin M.
