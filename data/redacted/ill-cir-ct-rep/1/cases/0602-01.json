One of these injunctions restrains the defendants as follows: \u201cFrom proceeding to complete the organization of \u2018The Elgin National Watch C\u00e1se Company\u2019 of Elgin, Illinois, \u2019 by recording in the office of the recorder of deeds of Kane county, Illinois, the final certificates of organization thereof heretofore issued by the secretary of state of the state of Illinois; and you, the said Charles A. Miller, recorder of Kane county, Illinois, from receiving, filing or recording said final certificate in your office as such recorder or otherwise; and you, the said Max C. Eppenstein, Sol C. Eppenstein and Thomas W. Duncan from in any manner-using or attempting to use the name \u2018The Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois, \u2019 in the business of manufacturing or selling watches, watch cases, jewelry,- or parts thereof or materials therefor, or any other name so nearly resembling the complainant\u2019s corporate name, Elgin National Watch Company, \u2019 as to be calculated to mislead or deceive, and from in any manner violating, infringing upon Or interfering with the complainant\u2019s corporate name aforesaid.\u201d The other injunction is substantially the same.\nIt is urged by solicitors for defendants that the action of the secretary of state in granting the final certificate to \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d is final and conclusive. The opinion of the supreme court of this state, cited in support of this position, being the Illinois Watch Case Company v. Pearson, 140 Ill. 423, 31 N. E. 400, as I read it, does not sustain this position.\nThe final certificate must be filed for record as required by the statute before the corporation is fully organized. \u201cIt is a condition precedent to the power of the corporation to proceed to business.\u201d Loverin v. McLaughlin, 46 Ill. App. 373, and eases there cited.\nThe certificate of incorporation or license issued by the secretary of state to \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d not having been recorded as required by the statute, that company is not a corporation de fare or de facto. As to the questions involved in the cases now before this court, the case of Bushnell v. Consolidated Ice Machine Co., 138 Ill. 67, 4 Am. R. R. & Cor. Rep. 527, 27 N. E. 596, is cited as being in conflict with this view. That case was Eeard before me, and the supreme court in affirming the opinion of this court does not decide as is argued.\nIt is objected also by solicitors for defendants that \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d is not made a party defendant to this cause, and that such company is a necessary party, and that this court can not entertain jurisdiction to determine as to the validity of its organization or its power to proceed to business in the absence of such company as a party. The complainants could not make that company a party defendant as a corporation, without by so doing admitting, for the purpose of these cases, that it is an existing corporation. People v. Rensselaer & Saratoga R. R. Co., 15 Wendell, 113. That is one of the issues presented for the court to determine.\nIt is also urged that this court has no jurisdiction of the defendant Charles A. Miller, recorder of Kane county.\nA writ of injunction of this court operates throughout the-state; Starr & Curtis\u2019 Statutes (first edition), chap. 37, sec. 68..\nAnd besides the recorder has filed his answer and submitted' himself to the jurisdiction of this court, stating, \u201cThat he shall in all respects obey said injunction of this honorable-court, and all other orders and directions which it may make-in the premises respecting this defendant.\u201d The jurisdiction of the court will be maintained. Vermont Farm Machine Co., v. Marble, Commissioner of Patents, 20 Fed. 117.\nOf the two bills before the court one is filed by \u201cElgin National Watch Company,\u201d and the other by \u201cElgin Watch Case Company.\u201d The name complained of is, \u201cThe Elgin. National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois.\u201d\nThe place of business and principal office of the two corporation complainants is in Chicago, Cook county, and the principal office and place of business of the proposed corporation is at Elgin, Kane county, Illinois.\nOn behalf of complainants it is urged that the use of the name, which it is claimed by the defendants they have the right to use, namely, \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois, \u2019 \u2019 will create confusion in business circles and among their customers, and cause great damage to the complainants, and especially the complainant, The Elgin National Watch Company.\nThese are all Illinois corporation names. It is held by the-supreme court of this state in Illinois Watch Case Company v. Pearson, 140 Ill. 423, 31 N. E. 400, that sections 2 and 50 of the Illinois statute, as to corporations, should be construed together, because, although embraced in different acts, they were passed at the same session of the legislature, etc. Section 2 applies to the original organization of corporations, and section 50 to the changing of names of corporations. In the section first named it is provided that \u201cno license shall be issued to two companies having the same name,\u201d and in section 50, that \u201cno name shall be assumed or adopted by any corporation similar to or liable to be mistaken for the name of any other corporation organized under the laws of this, state, without the consent of such other corporation.\u201d Aside: from and independent of the general rule laid down by the \u2022courts, the legislature has by this statute by implication provided that an Illinois corporation may, by proper legal proceedings, prevent the organization of any other corporation under the laws of this state, with the same or a similar corporate name, when the consent thereto of such existing corporation has not been obtained.\nThe protection of the public, as well as the rights of corporations or individuals, is to be considered by the court. It is clearly in the interest of the public that no corporation should be authorized, having the same name as a pre-existing corporation, and also that no name should be assumed by a corporation similar to or liable to be mistaken for the name of any \u2022other corporation organized under the laws of this- state.\nPutting the word \u201cThe\u201d at the commencement of the name and the words \u201cof Elgin, Illinois,\u201d at the conclusion, does not materially tend to prevent confusion. In ordinary use it would be called \u201cElgin National Watch Case Co.\u201d\nA large number of affidavits have been filed in these cases, from which it appears that confusion has arisen in regard to these names. These affidavits also tend to show actual damages to the complainant, The Elgin National Watch Company.\nIt appears that the defendants are seeking to establish or incorporate \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d as the successor of \u201cIllinois Watch Case Company,\u201d whose watch case factory has been for some time located at Elgin. It also appears that the \u201cIllinois Watch Case Company\u201d sought to change its name to \u201cElgin Watch Case Company,\u201d but that before such change of name was completed the complainant, \u201cElgin Watch Case Company,\u201d was incorporated under the general laws of this state, and thereupon the secretary of state refused a license to change the name of the \u201cIllinois Watch Case Company\u201d to the \u201cElgin Watch Case Company,\u201d presumably under the restriction contained in section 50 of the statute as to corporations above quoted, viz.: \u201cThat no name shall be assumed or adopted similar to, or liable to be mistaken for, the name of any other corporation.\u201d\nSome of the defendants, or those interested with them, thereupon applied to the supreme court of this state to obtain a writ of mandamus by which they sought to compel the secretary of state to issue the certificate of the change of name above indicated. The supreme court refused to so command; and it is the opinion of the supreme court in that case, cited above as \u201cIllinois Watch Case Company v. Pearson.\u201d\nThe fact that defendants are so anxious and so persistent in their determination to adopt this or some similar name may be regarded as an evidence that they think it is valuable and desirable. If valuable and desirable, why ? Is it not reasonable to presume that it is, in part, at least, because the complainant, the \u201cElgin National Watch Company,\u201d has made it so, when connected with watches or parts thereof ?\nWhen parties have,' by their mode of doing business, and by the quality of the product of their manufactories, and by selling and delivering to the public articles as valuable as represented or promised, built up under a chosen name, a reputation which is of great value, they should be protected in the use of that name.\nThe protection of the public in preventing any other persons from assuming a like or similar name is at the same time a protection of such parties. A trade-name, like a trade-mark, may be of great value, and that value may have been entirely created by the parties who seek to be protected in its use.\nThe words \u201cElgin\u201d and \u201cNational\u201d and \u201cWatch\u201d are general or geographical words or names that can not be appropriated to the exclusion of others; but they may be so used \u25a0when taken together or in connection with certain manufactured articles as to create and establish a special signification, and in the use of those words, or any or either of them, in such connection, and with such special signification, the parties entitled thereto should receive protection from the courts.\nA trade-name may not only be as valuable as is a trademark, but it will be protected the same as will a trade-mark. Gray v. Taper Sleeve Pulley Works, 16 Fed. 436.\nThe principles underlying the decisions supporting the views here expressed are: first, the injury to the public by leading them to suppose that the goods of one are the goods of the other, and, secondly, the injury to the owner of the trademark, or name, by the diversion of his trade into other channels, by the belief of the public that they are obtaining his goods. Farmers Loan & Trust Company v. Farmers Loan & Trust Company of Kansas, 21 Abbott\u2019s New Cases, 104.\nThe rule as to trade-names herein stated applies to corporations the same, as it does to individuals.\nThat confusion would follow if \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d should be incorporated and continue to transact business in that name, seems to me certain, and is supported by numerous affidavits. As an evidence to my mind that such confusion would follow I may say that I found it necessary to write these several names down and thus impress them clearly upon my mind to prevent confusion in considering these cases. That damage to the complainant watch company would result seems to be more than probable.\nFrom these conclusions it follows that the motion to dissolve the injunction must be denied.\nNOTE.\nFor an editorial note upon the right of one corporation to restrain the use of its corporate name by another corporation see pp. 463 et seq., supra.\u2014Ed.\nAffirmed 161 Ill. 417.\u2014Ed.", "type": "majority", "author": "Horton, J.:"}], "attorneys": ["W.

Corporate Naifes\u2014Right oe One Illinois Corporation to Enjoin the Recording oe a Certificate of Incorporation \u00f3e Another Illinois Corporation of a Similar Name. Certain of the defendants procured from the secretary of state a final certificate of incorporation of \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois,\u201d but before this certificate was recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of Kane County, Illinois, as required by statute, \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Company\u201d and the \u201cElgin Watch Case Company\u201d obtained a temporary injunction restraining the recording of the certificate of organization of \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company, of Elgin, Illinois.\u201d Upon motion of defendants to dissolve the injunction theretofore granted, held that the names were so-similar that confusion would result, and that the defendants, should be enjoined from procuring to be recorded in the recorder\u2019s office the certificate of incorporation of \u201cThe Elgin National Watch Case Company of Elgin, Illinois.\u201d\n2. Parties\u2014-Unorganized Corporation. Where the certificate of final organization of a corporation has not been filed in the recorder\u2019s office as required by statute, it is not necessary to-make such corporation a party defendant in a bill to enjoin the recording of the certificate, as by so doing the complainant would admit that it was an existing corporation.\n3. Power of Illinois Corporation to Prevent the Organization of Another Illinois Corporation of a Similar Name. The legislature has by implication provided that an Illinois corporation may, by proper legal proceedings, prevent the organization of any other corporation under the laws of this state, with the same or a similar corporate name, when the consent thereto of such existing corporation has not been obtained.\n4. Trade Names\u2014Protection of. When parties have, by their mode of doing business, and by the quality of their products, and, by selling and delivering to the public articles as valuable as represented, bult up under a chosen name a reputation which is of great value, they should be protected in the use of that name; and the protection of the public in preventing any other persons from assuming a like or similar name is at the same time a protection of the parties.\n5. Tbade Names\u2014Unfair Tbade. The words \u201cElgin\u201d and \u201cNational\u201d and \u201cWatch\u201d are general or geographical words or names that can not he appropriated to the exclusion of others; hut they may he so used when taken together or in connection with certain manufactured articles as to create and establish a special signification, and in the use of those words, or any or either of them, in such connection, and with such special signification, the parties entitled thereto should receive protection from the courts.\nMotion to dissolve injunction.
