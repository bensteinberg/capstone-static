If it would so survive, it may be assigned so as to pass the interest assigned to the assignee; if it doés not so survive, it is not assignable either at law or in equity.</p>

    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[292,632,1149,549]]]'>The evidence tends to show that Brewer &amp; Company served defendant with a copy of the contract of assignment, but that defendant refused to accept the same, or to acknowledge that it had’ any binding effect upon him. Neither at the time of the making or delivery of the assignment by Silverstein tq Brewer &amp; Company was there any wages due Silverstein from Gresheimer, but on the contrary it is claimed and not disputed, that Silverstein was then overpaid in the sum of seventy-one .($71) dollars. Gresheimer ignored the assignment and Silverstein continuing in his employment, he paid him his wages regularly.</p>

I am, however, inclined to hold to what I consider the better doctrine enunciated in the case of <em>Lightbody v. Smith, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=125%20Mass.%2051" class="citation" data-index="2">125 Mass. 51</a>, that except as to wages actually due at the time of an assignment, such an assignment is an attempt to transfer a mere possibility of future earnings and therefore as to such future earnings is not an existing <em>chose </em>in action.</p>

Smith, </em>and inferentially decided that where an action' could not be maintained on an assignment of demands having no actual existence at the time of the assignment, resort might be had to equity after the demands intended were subsequently brought into existence. This rule of law would be fatal to a recovery in this cause on the law side of the court, where we find it.</p>
