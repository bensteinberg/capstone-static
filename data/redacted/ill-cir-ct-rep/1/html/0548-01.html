There have been in this case two motions to dissolve: one made by the board of trade, which was granted on the ground that the board of trade have the right to control their own premises and to permit anybody to come upon them or deny anybody the right to come upon them. At the time I dissolved that motion I intimated that I thought it a very different question with reference to the telegraph company. I still think the telegraph company stands upon an entirely different basis. The telegraph company is in the exercise of a public franchise; it holds itself out according to the allegations of the bill, and these allegations are not denied, to furnish these commercial reports to such persons as agree to its reasonable terms and regulations, and it is in the business of furnishing to such persons as make contracts with it and comply with its reasonable regulations, these commercial reports which it gathers up, attracts into its possession or gets control of by the messengers and agents it is permitted to have upon the floor of the board of trade. Mow, it is said, it must refuse to transmit these commercial reports to the complainant in this case, because the board of trade says it shall do so, and threatens to drive it off the board of trade and deprive it of the facility of obtaining the information unless it complies with that demand. I have never seen how a telegraph com<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>pany can be permitted, either of its own will or at the command or behest of another party, to discriminate in its service to the public. The theory that it may do this because this is not regular telegraph business—that is, it is not a dispatch signed by one person and handed to the company to be sent to another person, is the narrowest construction that can be given to telegraph business. To say it is in that business, .and that the company need not engage in it if it does not want to, and then to argue from that, because the company might not be compelled, under forfeiture of its charter to engage in transmitting commercial news, that it may distinguish the persons it will transmit commercial news to, seems to me false reasoning. The business of transmitting commercial news has grown to be an exceedingly important business. I suppose it will not be extravagant to say, that it forms a very large part of the business of the telegraph companies as they are run at the present day. That the commercial information that they gather up by their agents at the different commercial •centres, such as the price of grain, the price of stocks, railroad stocks, is most important information to the general public, and to people engaged in different occupations it can be seen at a glance. The business being to a certain extent incidental, is telegraph business in this sense: the company can exercise the power of eminent domain for the purpose of carrying it on; it has the right to condemn my land, or your land, or the land of any other citizen, and put its poles thereon for the express purposes of its business,' and for this purpose alone of transmitting commercial news dispatches. If it exercises the power of eminent domain, it cannot be said that the business for which it exercises it, is special business and they can discriminate as to the persons they will send it to. The rule governing chartered bodies is always to prevent them discriminating against anybody, as that is the most dangerous way of building up monopoly. If the company can discriminate in the sending of commercial dispatches between different persons in a community, it may enrich one man and impoverish .-another one. Now, it does not seem that the law will permit that to be done upon any excuse whatever. The position taken <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>by counsel that a court of equity will not compel a company to transmit to an individual because the telegraph company can be made to supply the public,' has its only support in eases, in which there were no public questions involved at all, but where it was a mere question of private interests. I think this is clearly shown in the case of <em>Hawley v. Beardsley, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=47%20Conn.%20571" class="citation" data-index="6">47 Conn. 571</a>.</p>

I can conceive no rule under which damages can be claimed. Of late this has been -discovered and recognized all over the country. There is no other way to control these chartered companies, than by an appeal to a court of equity, and the courts of equity have issued these mandatory injunctions to prevent any discriminations at all. Now, there would appear some sort of incongruity in saying that the board of trade may drive anybody off: its floors and still that the company must furnish these dispatches; in my opinion there is none whatever. I do not find it necessary to agree with a recent opinion that the board of trade may be controlled, or compelled to furnish, or let anyone get at its market reports. I do not find it necessary to decide that question one way or another. The board of trade may-shut its doors and windows, and shut off all the ways by which its doings could be got to the public, and conduct its business in secret. That this would be a very bad thing for the board of trade to do I have no doubt. If the board of trade see fit to let the telegraph companies get the news, and the telegraph companies hold themselves out to supply it to all persons who will comply with its reasonable terms and regulations, it cannot give it to one person and withhold it from another. When the news passes from the board of trade to the telegraph companies, it belongs to the telegraph companies, and they must transmit to one person as another. If the board of trade puts the telegraph company off its floor, well and good. It is better that the telegraph company be-prevented from getting the news at all than that it be per<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>mitted under any excuse whatever to discriminate against any member of the public who wants to receive their work, and will comply with its reasonable conditions. As I said, if the board of trade puts the telegraph companies off its floors, well and good, the telegraph companies cannot send news they cannot get.</p>

It comes here as the case of a perfectly honest institution, carrying on, so far as the evidence before the court shows an honest business, just like any other honest business engaged in dealing on the board of trade. In that case a telegraph company engaged in transmitting commercial dispatches cannot refuse to supply it with such news; and, therefore, I cannot dissolve this injunction.</p>
