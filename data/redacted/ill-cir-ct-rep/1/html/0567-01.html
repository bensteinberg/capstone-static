The de<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>fendant answered the bill and filed a cross bill against the complainant to cancel a prior trust deed for the sum of $1,400 made September 22, 1894, and also a prior trust deed for the sum of $200 dated April 29, 1895, and also a trust deed for the sum of $200 dated September 18, 1899, made contemporaneously with the trust deed the complainants sought to foreclose. The cause was referred to Master in Chancery G. Fred Rush to take proofs and report his conclusions both as to the law and the facts to the court. The facts as disclosed by the report showed the following: The defendant De Grazie was an Italian immigrant who could neither read nor write and hardly understood the English language. On September 22, 1894, he applied to one Herman B. Wickersham, a lawyer and real estate and loan agent in the city of Chicago, for a loan of $1,400 and gave as security a trust deed upon certain real estate in Chicago. The trust deed matured five years after date. On April 29, 1895, the defendant De -Grazie applied for a further loan of $200 and gave as security a second trust deed upon the same real estate, maturing three years after date. De Grazie made payments upon these loans from time to time and on September 18, 1899, the $200 note secured by the second trust deed had been paid but the trust deed had not been released. On the latter date De Grazie executed two trust deeds, one for the sum of $1,200 and the other for -the sum of $200 in place of the $1,400 trust deed of September 22, 1894. In 1889 De Grazie had purchased the mortgaged premises from Wickersham and had paid the purchase price thereof in small installments from time to time as he was able to do. These payments weré made prior to 1894. Wickersham was the trustee in each of the trust deeds. After the execution of the two trust deeds in September, 1899, De Grazie made an agreement with Wickersham that he might make payments on his indebtedness in small installments as he was able and as he had done in his previous dealings with Wicker-sham*. De Grazie or some member of his family made payments upon the principal and in addition paid the interest upon both loans as the same matured. The evidence disclosed that De Grazie made the various payments at the office of <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>Wickersham and in each instance received a receipt in the following form:</p>

    <p id="b587-6" data-blocks='[["BL_587.6",587,[210,734,1147,590]]]'>The bill was filed to foreclose the trust deed of September 18, 1899, for the sum of $1,200. The evidence disclosed that De Grazie had up to the date of the filing of the bill, paid upon the entire indebtedness of $1,400 the sum of $1,000 and nil the interest accruing up to the time of the filing of the bill. De Grazie had no notice of any kind at the time of the making of the various payments to Wickersham that any person other than Wickersham was the owner or holder of any of the notes secured by the various trust deeds. On September 15, 1902, however, De Grazie received a letter from Frank E. Hayner, the former partner of Wickersham, which letter was as follows:</p>

Wickers-ham tore the letter open and threw it into the waste basket .and told De Grazie to pay him (Wickersham). De Grazie thereupon paid him the interest and $200 on account of the principal and received a receipt in the form above described. The evidence disclosed that Wickersham remitted the full .amount of the interest due on September 18, 1902, to the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>complainant who was the owner of the interest note. In November, 1902, Wiekersham became insolvent, fled the country and became a fugitive from justice. A large number of indictments for embezzlement were thereafter returned against Wiekersham. The complainants showed that the notes secured by the trust deeds were transferred to them shortly after the execution of the trust deeds. It was contended by the complainants that the payments made by De Grazie to Wickersham should not be credited upon the notes secured by the several trust deeds for the reason that the complainants were-the owners of the notes and Wiekersham had no authority to receive any part of the principal of the debt. It was also-contended that the letter sent by Hayner to De Grazie on September 15, 1902, was notice to De Grazie that Wiekersham was not the owner of the notes secured by the trust deeds. The cause came before the court on exceptions to the report of G. Fred Rush, who was appointed a special commissioner-after his term of office as master in chancery had expired. The court held that an assignee of a trust deed or mortgage takes the same subject to existing equities between the-mortgagor and the mortgagee; that the assignee of a mortgage or trust deed, in order to protect his rights against secret equities between mortgagor and mortgagee, must give-notice to the grantor in the mortgage that he is the owner and holder of the note; that in the absence of such notice, payments made to the trustee in the mortgage before maturity, will be applied on the note so secured in a bill to foreclose-the trust deed. It was also held that the notice from Hayner to pay the interest due to him was not a sufficient notice that he was the owner or holder or the agent of the owner or holder-of the principal notes.</p>
