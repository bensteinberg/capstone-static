Law Rep. 1464</a>, the gas company procured an ordinance requiring it “to supply consumers of gas at the rate of not exceeding !j!2 per thousand cubic feet.” The company, and the city before it, had for more than twenty years been in the habit of charging and consumers were accustomed to pay, in addition for the charge for gas, a meter rent at the rate of twenty-five cents per month. Complainant sued to recover the meter rents paid by him. The court said: “Appellee is entitled to recover such sums as he paid for meter rent for the five years preceding the filing of his pleading in which he asserts his claim. If the appellant was not entitled to collect meter rent under the terms of the contract, then honor and good conscience required it to be returned although the payment was voluntarily made.”</p>

There the plaintiff made almost daily shipments of milk for thirteen years over the defendant’s railroad without agreement as to the rates and without any complaint that the charge was excessive. Suit was brought to recover an excess over what was claimed to be a reasonable charge. The court denied a recovery, saying: “What is a reasonable sum for transportation of goods on the great railroad lines of the country in a given case is often a complex question, into which enters many elements and considerations, and is incapable of exact solution. * * * The common-law duty does not preclude special contracts between railroad corporations and shippers regulating the freight charge; and where, as in this case, the freight had been carried for a long course of years at schedule price, the shipper making no objection and no inquiry as to the reasonableness of the charge, and when it was his interest to object if the charge was unreasonable, he must, we think, be deemed to have assented to the charge as reasonable, and to have voluntarily waived any objection thereto'.

      <em>supra, </em>the court said: “A distinction may well he made between cases depending upon the common-law duty to carry goods at a reasonable compensation and those where, by the statute, the rate is fixed by comparison, or discrimination is prohibited. In the latter class of cases the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the company fixing the rate, and the presumption indulged by the party making the payment would naturally be that the statute was being complied with. * * * In <em>Killmer v.
