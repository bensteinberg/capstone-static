Mc-Conoughey, a Cook county justice of the peace, for alleged violations of this act. Relator is the agent at Chicago of the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, a Missouri corporation, with its brewery and principal office at the city of St. Louis in said state. The trade mark of said brewing company appearing on bottles and barrels of beer vended at Chicago by the relator consisting of a device in which stars and stripes appear on a shield in conjunction with an eagle alleged to be the national emblem, is the <em>gravarhen </em>of the offense which is claimed to be a violation of the act for which the arrests were made, to free himself from which relator has sued out the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in this case. The trade mark which it is claimed is violative of the statute has been registered as&gt; such in the patent office of the United States and so’ certified by the commissioner of patents in pursuance of the act of Congress regulating.the registration of “trade marks.”</p>

If, therefore, the act in question is unconstitutional it is for some inherent infirmity which would make it equally so, were it an act of the Federal congress.</p>

The fallacy of the argument lies in the assumption that a “trade mark” is in effect a component part of an article of commerce because it is a medium of sale; while in fact it is the goods, of which the trade mark is no integral part, which constitutes the commercial article. The registration of a trade mark under the act of congress providing for such registration grants unto' the party registering it, protection against its infringement by others, and nothing more.</p>
    <p id="Aj5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[228,855,1148,644]]]'>It is contended upon the part of the state that the enactment of the “Flag Law Statute,” is an exercise of the police power of the legislature, and it is urged with much earnestness and confidence that the statute rests for its support upon that fundamental principle. What constitutes the police power is a question of law to be determined by the court. <em>Eden v. The People, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=161%20Ill.%20296" class="citation" data-index="0">161 Ill. 296</a>; <em>Lake View v.

Is the use of the national flag or emblem for commercial purposes or as an advertising medium a subject for police regulation? If it is, it must be upon the-theory that such regulation is conducive to the health, morals, peace or security of the property rights of the people of the state.</p>

The national flag, wherever found, stands for our highest ideals of a free government, a free people, with free and enlightened institutions; it stands for valor, for patriotism; it is the standard under whose fold the citizen goes to war and sheds his life’s blood for his country’s honor and protection. By an act of the legislature passed in 1897, <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the national flag was directed to be unfurled over public schools and public institutions, prescribing penalties for its violation.</p>

    <p id="Aya" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[290,861,1150,1304]]]'>Does the exemption from the operation of the act, which in •section 2 provides that “Nothing in this act shall be construed •as affecting either public or private exhibitions of art,” constitute such a discrimination in favor of a particular class as to make the act come within that coterie of laws denominated class legislation ? By section 2 of this act public and private ■exhibitions of art are excluded from its operation—that is plain. It might be contended that public exhibitions of art were for the benefit of and belonging to the people, and therefore it was an exemption which was not either in reality or effect a discrimination against or in favor of any particular class; and while such a contention is tenable it can not be so claimed as to “private exhibitions of art.” It will'be assumed that private exhibitions are for the benefit and profit of the indiviluals owning the exhibition. There is no limit as to what may be be so exhibited and no definition of how the flag or emblem shall be used in these “private exhibitions of art.” Such an exhibition might contain artistic representations of the various unique devices, by which, anterior to July 1, 1899, merchants and traders were wont to designate their ¡several articles of merchandise by using in numberless ways the national flag or emblem. Such private exhibitions would naturally be for profit and thereby the privileged class contemplated by section 2 would be authorized to do just what anuther and different class are prohibited from doing by section 1 of that act.</p>

The Ritchie caséis commonly known as the <em>Sweat Shop Case. </em>It was enacted for the regulation of a particular and designated class; of workers, and was held to be repugnant to the constitution and void. The court said: ‘‘We are inclined to regard the act as one which is partial and discriminating in its character. If it be construed as applying only to manufacturers of clothing, wearing apparel and articles of a similar nature, we can see no reasonable ground from prohibiting such manufacturers and their employes from contracting for more than eight hours of work in one day, while other manufacturers and their-employes are not forbidden to so contract. If the act be construed as applying to manufacturers of all kinds of products there is no good reason why the prohibition should be directed' against manufacturers and their employes and not against merchants or builders or contractors or carriers or farmers or-persons engaged in other branches of industry and their employes therein. Women employed by manufacturers are forbidden by section 5 to make contracts to labor longer than-eight hours in a day, while women employed as saleswomen in stores or as domestic servants, or as bookkeepers or stenographers, or typewriters, or in laundries, or other occupations, not embraced under the head of manufacturing, are at liberty to contract for as many hours of labor in a day as they choose. The manner in which the section thus discriminates against, one class of employers and employes and in favor of all others, places it in opposition to the constitutional guaranties herein before discussed and so renders it invalid. ’ ’</p>
