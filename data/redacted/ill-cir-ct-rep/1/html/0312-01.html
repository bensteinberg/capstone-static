Moreover that which at one time is not <em>ultra vires </em>may become so. One corporation may innocently acquire a small interest in another corporation in payment of a debt, and may thereafter purchase an additional minority interest for the purpose of securing control. It cannot be doubted that the entire holding would become <em>ultra vires </em>and illegal in Illinois under such circumstances.</p>
