In Illinois the age of legal consent to marriage is seventeen years in males and fourteen years in females. The complainant was married to the defendant while he was under the age of seventeen years and ceased to cohabit with her before he arrived at that age. Upon a bill filed by him to annul such marriage it was held that the marriage was voidable, and that inasmuch as complainant had not cohabited with defendant after he arrived at the age of consent, he was entitled to disaffirm the contract of marriage and have the same annulled.</p>
