There can be no question but that the proceeding by <em>quo warranto, </em>where it is sought to call in question, as in this case, the right of officials to levy taxes and thereby injure the private property of relators, is in fact a civil proceeding, although in form criminal, and that the proceeding by <em>quo warranto </em>is the' proper proceeding to test the legality of the school district referred to and the right of the alleged board to levy taxes, therefor.</p>

The cause shown by the state’s attorney in substance is, that he has examined the relator’s complaint as to the illegality of the high school district organization and became satisfied that the public interest did not require any attack upon the validity of the high school district, and that petitioner’s objection to the legality of the proceedings organizing the district, were technical and without merit; also that in the discharge of his duty as state’s attor<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>ney and in the exercise of the prerogative of his office, he had refused to file the petition, or to give leave for the use of his name in the proceedings.</p>

If it could be, this petitioner, appealing to a court of justice for relief against taxes assumed to be levied by persons assuming legal powers, finds the state’s attorney barring his way and refusing him entrance to the court. If he can do this in one case, he can do it in any and- can keep any person in office whom he may desire, without regard to whether such person is legally entitled to the office or not.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[206,1203,1146,246]]]'>It is not a question of the good faith of the state’s attorney, and if his position is correct, it is immaterial whether he acts in good faith or bad faith.

    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[204,1459,1152,448]]]'>The state’s attorney is an officer of the court and neither he nor any other officer of the court, when it relates to the individual rights of suitors, shall be heard to say that he has more power than the court itself. He does not carry the key of the court room in his pocket to admit whomsoever he pleases. The law requires a relator in a case like this at bar to give-security for costs. The relator alleges he has employed his: own attorney to attend to the case and he only asks the nominal use of the name of the state’s attorney.</p>

But so far as the private rights of the relator are concerned, the use of the name of the state’s attorney or attorney-general is a mere matter of form, a mere fiction which has come down to us from the English law, and is of no more use in determining the rights of the relator, or of other parties <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>interested, than had the use of the names of John Doe and Richard Roe in the old form of the action of ejectment.</p>

Ridgley, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=21%20Ill.%2064" class="citation" data-index="3">21 Ill. 64</a>; and <em>People v.

Under the English decisions the 9th of Ann was held “to let in every person who desired it to make use of the king’s name in actions of <em>quo warranto, </em>and that the act did not leave it to the discretion of the crown officers but put it in the discretion of the court. Cole, Criminal Information, p. 125, and cases cited bearing on the same question. See <em>Commonwealth v.

If the interests of the people suffer thereby, it may be because the state’s attorney refuses to have the people represented in the case.</p>
