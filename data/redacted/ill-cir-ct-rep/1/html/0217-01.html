It certainly does not seem to me, that the pleader in this case is warranted in the conclusion reached by him under the averments of this indictment as to the alleged duty of these defendants, or either of them. The court, upon a careful reading of this ordinance, fails to discover that it imposes any special duty upon all, or any, or either of these defendants. It certainly is not the duty of the court to criticise the indictment, or sustain a motion to quash the same, upon <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>mere technical grounds, and if the indictment is to be quashed it should be by reason of some substantial defect. It appears to me, that the direct and proximate cause of this terrible disaster was not brought about, or occasioned, by reason of the alleged fact that these defendants (even had the duty devolved upon them as alleged in the indictment) had not placed in said theatre building the flue pipe of sheet metal construction, the automatic sprinkler and other appliances therein enumerated, but the direct cause was the fire itself. The object and purpose of these safe-guards was to do away with the smoke in case of fire and, at the same time, provide means for extinguishing the same. It is also alleged in the indictment that a certain lighted arc lamp was being operated on the south side of the stage in said theatre during the progress of said theatrical performance therein mentioned, negligently and carelessly and without due caution and circumspection, put, placed and kept near a certain drapery which was then and there situated on, in and about said stage, by reason of which said putting, placing and keeping said are lamp near said drapery, said drapery was then and there ignited and set on fire by said arc lamp, which said fire could then and there have been easily extinguished had there then and there been in said building, and on said stage, the fire apparatus, appliances, etc., as required by said laws and ordinances of said city of Chicago, and which said fire could then and there have been easily extinguished and put out if there had then and there been in said building, and on said stage, any portable fire extinguishers, or hand fire pumps, as provided by said ordinances.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[309,1874,1144,443]],["BL_263.1",263,[239,412,1143,186]]]'>It will be observed that there is no averment in this indictment to the effect, that these defendants, or either of them, placed, or caused to be placed, or exercised, ■ or attempted to exercise, any control over said arc lamp; neither are they charged with negligence or lack of due caution and circumspection, relative to said lamp. Every intendment being against the pleader, the presumption is, that said arc lamp was not placed there by these defendants and that they did not, or either of them exercise, or attempt to exercise, any control <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>over the same. In my judgment the lack of an averment of this character is fatal to this indictment, and if <em>for no' other reason, </em>the indictment, on motion to quash, should not be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[239,614,1161,751]]]'>In passing, I desire also to state, that it is my judgment, that there is no privity between these defendants and that a motion to quash should be. sustained on the ground of a misjoinder. I realize fully how difficult it is to draw an indictment to fit the facts, or the alleged facts, in this case. It is easy to find fault with an indictment and yet more difficult to draw it. So I am inclined to hold, in addition to the reasons given by Judge Kersten, and for the reasons therein indicated, that these substantial objections to this indictment should be sustained. It does not appear to me to be proper at this time or place to pass upon the motion to quash in behalf of the defendant Noonan and Cummings, but when the case properly comes before me at Peoria, I will say frankly to. counsel, that I shall not hesitate to sustain a motion to quash for the reasons herein indicated.</p>
