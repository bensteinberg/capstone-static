Vicki Tatera, individually and as Special Administrator of the Estate of her deceased husband, Walter M. Tatera, appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment to FMC Corporation in this product liability case. The trial court dismissed the case on the basis that Tatera had not presented a prima facie case for either a strict liability or a negligence claim. Tatera contends that the trial court erred in dismissing the case at the summary judgment stage. We agree with the trial court that Tatera has not presented a prima facie case for strict liability and affirm on that claim. But we conclude that Tatera has presented a prima facie case for negligence and genuine issues of material fact exist; thus, summary judgment should not have been granted on that claim. We affirm the judgment as to strict liability but reverse and remand for further proceedings on the negligence claim.</p>

Walter died from malignant mesothelioma on September 20, 2004. Walter's widow, Vicki Tatera (hereinafter "Tatera"), attributed the malignant mesothelioma to Walter's exposure to asbestos during the time he worked at B&amp;M Machine, which was a machine shop <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>owned by Walter's father. Walter was employed at B&amp;M Machine in 1963, 1964 and 1967-1993. Walter's responsibilities included working with friction brake materials. His job involved grinding asbestos-containing brake linings down to the right shape and size. Tatera alleges that during this process, dust or fibers emanating from the asbestos products would be emitted into the immediate area. One employee indicated that this work created "dust all over the shop."</p>
    <p id="b794-4" data-blocks='[["BL_794.4",794,[259,871,1148,507]]]'>¶ 3. In 1967, FMC became the successor to the Stearns Company, a manufacturer of industrial brakes and clutch components in Milwaukee since 1917. FMC did not manufacture the brake lining itself. Rather, it purchased that part from brake lining manufacturers. Tatera alleges that FMC sent over 18,000 friction lining parts to B&amp;M to be machined. After the linings were complete, they were returned to FMC to be assembled into the final brake system, which was then sold to others who installed them in automobiles.</p>

In September 2004, Tatera filed this lawsuit against FMC and the brake lining manufacturers. Tatera asserted claims against FMC based upon strict liability and negligence. She asserts that during the course of his employment, Walter "was exposed to dust or fibers emanating from the asbestos products . . . designed, sold, manufactured, distributed, packaged, removed, installed, or otherwise placed into commerce" by FMC. She further asserts that this exposure caused Walter to develop malignant mesothelioma, which ultimately resulted in his death. The complaint alleged that FMC was negligent in that it knew of the danger, had a duty to warn Walter of the dangers associated with asbestos and the failure to warn was a direct cause of the injuries suffered here. The complaint also alleged that FMC should be held strictly <a id="p695" href="#p695" data-label="695" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*695</a>liable for Walter's injuries on the basis that it "manufactured, supplied or installed a product. . . that was unreasonably dangerous" by failing to warn or provide instructions to take precautions while using the product. Tatera further alleged that the product was improperly designed and that Walter's exposure to the "unreasonably dangerous products" caused his injuries.</p>
    <p id="b795-4" data-blocks='[["BL_795.4",795,[197,815,1150,568]]]'>¶ 5. FMC denied the allegations against it and asserted that even if the allegations were true, it was not "hable as a matter of law because (1) the elements necessary to establish a claim for strict liability do not exist, and (2) [FMC] owed no duty to Mr. Tatera, an employee of an independent contractor, and thus could not be found negligent." FMC filed a summary judgment motion on this basis in May 2006, which was denied by the Honorable Claire Fiorenza on August 24, 2006. FMC filed a petition seeking leave to appeal from the nonfinal order to this court, which we denied in October 2006.</p>
    <p id="b795-5" data-blocks='[["BL_795.5",795,[197,1396,1151,514]]]'>¶ 6. On August 1, 2007, due to judicial rotation, the Honorable Timothy G. Dugan replaced Judge Fiorenza as presiding judge in this case. On August 10, 2007, FMC renewed its summary judgment motion, making the same arguments which had been denied earlier. The trial court agreed to hear the motion over the objection of the plaintiff. In September 2007, the trial court granted FMC's motion and dismissed all of Tatera's claims against FMC. Judgment was entered and Tatera now appeals.</p>

The issue in this appeal with regard to the strict liability claim is whether Wisconsin law permits <a id="p696" href="#p696" data-label="696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*696</a>the application of the Restatement (Second) op Torts § 402A (1965)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to the unique facts of this case, which involve a product provided to the employee of a subcontractor for further processing before reaching the ultimate consumer. More particularly, the issues here are whether, FMC was a "seller," Walter Tatera was a "consumer" and brake linings were "products," within the meaning of § 402A. No Wisconsin case answers these questions. Besides arguing the plain meaning of § 402A and its comments, Tatera relies on one Pennsylvania case, <em>Kalumetals, Inc. v. Hitachi Magnetics Corp., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=21%20F.%20Supp.%202d%20510" class="citation" data-index="0">21 F. Supp. 2d 510</a> (W.D. Pa. 1998) to support her position that § 402A applies to these facts. FMC distinguishes <em>Kalumetals </em>and argues that it provides support for FMC's position that public policy would oppose application of strict product liability to this case. Additionally FMC relies on cases from other jurisdictions, which support its position.</p>
    <p id="b796-3" data-blocks='[["BL_796.3",796,[245,1382,1149,588]]]'>¶ 8. We conclude, as noted in the comments to Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A, there may be cases that are appropriate for application of strict product liability to injuries, which occur in the processing of a product before it reaches the consumer, such as occurred in <em>Kalumetals. </em>But, based on § 402A, Wisconsin case law, and other common law around the country to date, strict product liability has not yet evolved to include the factual situation presented here. Accordingly, Tatera has not presented a prima facie case of strict product liability.</p>

We review the applicability of the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A to the facts of this case and orders for summary judgments independently from the trial court, employing the same methodology as the trial court. <em>See Green Spring Farms v.

The definition of "seller," "product" and "user" has evolved since Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A was first written. Originally, strict product liability, as set forth in comment c to § 402A was to protect the public from injury due to corrupt food, without requiring any showing of negligence by the food seller. Over time, strict liability has been more broadly applied to "products" outside the food industry, <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>

Although Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A has been more broadly applied over time, it has not yet been applied to processing of products in Wisconsin. In <em>Dippel, </em>the "seller" was a manufacturer and sales distributor, the "user" a tavern patron, and the "product" a pool table. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=201%20N.W.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="19">Id.,</a> </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=37%20Wis.%202d%20443" class="citation" data-index="20">37 Wis. 2d at 447-48</a>.

The facts here do not precisely fit the language of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A or Wisconsin case law. The undisputed facts in this record show that the friction brake linings were not manufactured or sold by FMC. FMC had purchased the brake linings (some of which contained asbestos) from other manufacturers<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and then contracted with B&amp;M to grind the linings down to fit the brake metal. In the time period of Tatera's claim, FMC provided B&amp;M with <a id="p700" href="#p700" data-label="700" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*700</a>18,000 friction brake linings to grind. After grinding the brake linings, B&amp;M returned the brake linings to FMC for further processing until they were completed brakes, which FMC sold to the automotive industry to be put into cars. Tatera's husband was employed by B&amp;M to grind the friction brake linings and later died from mesothelioma. He was not a purchaser of a car with asbestos-containing brakes.</p>
    <p id="b800-3" data-blocks='[["BL_800.4",800,[256,833,1149,672]]]'>¶ 15. Tatera argues that: (1) FMC was a "seller" under Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A; (2) Walter Tatera was a "consumer"; and (3) friction brake linings were "products." Both parties' briefs concede that the meanings of "seller," "product" and "user" are all interrelated. FMC argues that § 402A does not apply in this processing situation and the trial court was correct to dismiss the claim at summary judgment. The trial court, in granting FMC's summary judgment motion, noted the absence of clear precedent in Wisconsin, or anywhere else, and acknowledged that this court and perhaps the Wisconsin Supreme Court would undoubtedly have to resolve this issue.</p>

In comment f to § 402A, the "seller" is described as any manufacturer, wholesale or retail dealer or distributor. The rule provides further that the "seller" must be engaged in the business of "selling" the products for use or consumption. Because FMC provided the friction brake linings to be processed as part of their business of selling brakes, Tatera argues they are a "seller."</p>

      <a id="p701" href="#p701" data-label="701" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*701</a>¶ 17. Tatera argues that the policy behind the rule supports its application to FMC as a "seller." She relies on comment f, which states: "The basis for the rule is the ancient one of the special responsibility for the safety of the public undertaken by one who enters into the business of supplying human beings with products which may endanger the safety of their persons and property." Because FMC supplied asbestos-containing brake linings, which may endanger a worker like Walter Tatera, Tatera argues that § 402A should apply to FMC. But she fails to acknowledge the second half of the comment's policy statement: "... and the forced reliance upon that undertaking on the part of those <em>who purchase such goods." </em>(Emphasis added.)

Tatera characterizes the work done by her husband as "preparing the product for consumption" and therefore covered by § 402A. FMC takes the contrary view. While the comments state that the "consumer" does not have to actually consume the product (instead he can be one who prepares the product for consumption like a cook or an employee of a car sales company preparing the car for the buyer), the "user/consumer" in the examples in the comments is only one short step from the <em>ultimate </em>consumer, lending support to FMC's position. In addition, the comment does not describe a processer as "user," in fact, it expressly refrained from taking a position on whether a processer is a user. Restatement (Second) of Touts § 402A cmt. p. Because § 402A refers to the ultimate "user or consumer" and excludes the person who processes a product for someone other than the ultimate consumer, we conclude that the meaning of "user," as applied here, excludes a processor under the facts of this case.</p>

First, we examine the factual proofs in the record to determine if they support the two challenged elements of Tatera's Restatement (Second) of Torts § 388 negligence claim, "knew or had reason to know" and "no duty to warn." The record shows that in FMC's first summary judgment motion before Judge Fiorenza, Tatera submitted excerpts of Mazurek's deposition. The deposition shows that: (1) Mazurek worked for Stearns (now FMC)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and the company purchased asbestos-containing friction brake linings in the 1970's and 1980's from several manufacturers; (2) FMC knew <a id="p712" href="#p712" data-label="712" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*712</a>some of the friction materials contained asbestos; (3) from 1974-1975, the company undertook testing of the <em>asbestos content </em>of some of the friction materials; (4) that testing resulted in documents that Mazurek had seen; (5) FMC probably started supplying the material safety data sheets when OSHA required them to, which would have been in the late 1970's to early 1980's; (6) FMC provided material safety data sheets to customers who asked for them and those sheets would have contained information regarding what materials were in the discs; (7) Mazurek did not know whether FMC ever provided any material safety data sheets to job shops in general or B&amp;M in particular; and (8) FMC never put warnings on its asbestos-containing brakes or clutch products.</p>

In addition to these factual submissions by Tatera for the first round of summary judgment, the parties once again briefed the issues and submitted proofs when Judge Dugan agreed to reconsider Judge Fiorenza's decision denying FMC's summary judgment motion. Tatera submitted excerpts from Mazurek's deposition again, but this time, submitted fewer pages. Two of the pages submitted had been filed with the motion heard by Judge Fiorenza, but two new pages were also submitted. In the new pages, Mazurek testified that he did not believe FMC ever tested whether asbestos would be released in a customer's normal use of the product nor in the job shop's use of the product.</p>

Tatera's motion included an affidavit from scientist, Richard Hatfield, asserting that based on his studies, it is not necessary for asbestos-containing materials to undergo substantial changes before these materials will release asbestos fibers. His studies showed that the dust sitting on the discs in a box contained asbestos fibers. Tatera further proffered an <a id="p713" href="#p713" data-label="713" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*713</a>affidavit from Dr. Henry Anderson stating that: (1) "the vast majority of malignant mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos exposure"; (2) "[a]ll exposures to asbestos contribute to the disease malignant mesothelioma, provided these exposures occurred more than ten years" before diagnosis; (3) "[m]alignant mesothelioma generally has a latency period of twenty to forty years after exposure to asbestos"; and (4) there is no known "safe level" of "exposure to asbestos below which there is no risk of developing malignant mesothelioma."</p>

We conclude that even without page 59 of the Mazurek deposition, the above facts, which are properly within the record, allow Tatera's negligence claim to go forward. As to FMC's absence of proof on the "knew or should have known" element, the record above would allow the factfinder to draw a reasonable inference from the facts that: (1) OSHA required safety data sheets; (2) FMC knew there was asbestos in the friction brake linings; and (3) FMC did their own asbestos content testing. From these, a reasonable jury could conclude that FMC knew or should have known of the potential of harm from asbestos to those who would use that product. <em>See Lecus v. American Mut. Ins.

FMC's second claim, that the duty to warn element could not be proven, is based on <em>Haase </em>and <em>Mohr. </em>In <em>Haase, </em>the court of appeals first adopted the sophisticated user defense in Wisconsin in a Restatement (Second) of Torts § 388 negligence claim. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=260%20N.W.2d%20241" class="citation" data-index="72">Id.,</a> </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=266%20Wis.%202d%20970" class="citation" data-index="73">266 Wis. 2d 970</a>, ¶¶ 1, 21.

Here, Mazurek testified at his deposition that to his knowledge, FMC never sent content sheets to B&amp;M telling them of the presence of asbestos in the friction brake linings. This fact alone is evidence of a material factual dispute as to whether B&amp;M knew of the asbestos presence and danger. Such was not the case in <em>Haase, </em>where it was undisputed that warnings were issued on the defendant's invoices and other materials accompanying shipment of the product to the employer of the injured party. <em>Id., </em>¶ 7.

The <em>Mohr </em>case supports Tatera's position. In <em>Mohr, </em>the court of appeals reversed a grant of summary judgment on negligence and strict liability grounds, finding that material factual disputes existed in the record. <em>Id., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=269%20Wis.%202d%20302" class="citation" data-index="74">269 Wis. 2d 302</a>, ¶ 2.

Applying the language of <em>Mohr </em>to Tatera's facts, the correct way to frame the sophisticated user defense is whether FMC had reason to believe that B&amp;M had knowledge that the friction brake materials were dangerous when tooled. <em>See id., </em>¶ 20. Here, at the summary judgment juncture, Tatera has offered proofs that B&amp;M was not told that there was asbestos in the friction brake materials and was not told that asbestos was dangerous when worked on by its employees.
