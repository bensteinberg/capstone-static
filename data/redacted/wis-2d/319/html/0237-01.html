Heppner were married in May of 1974, when he was just shy of his twenty-second birthday and she was almost twenty-three. They were divorced in March of 2008. Ms. Heppner appeals the judgment of divorce, contending that the trial court erred in deciding that maintenance payable by Mr. Heppner should end when he turns sixty on May 30, 2012. She also asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that: (1) Mr. Heppner's stock options exercised by him after the divorce were not to be considered in determining the amount of Mr. Heppner's maintenance obligation; and (2) those of Mr. Heppner's stock options whose grant price exceeded the value of the stock as of the divorce would be awarded to Mr. Heppner because they allegedly had "no value." We modify the judgment in part, <em>see </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20808.09" class="citation" data-index="0">Wis.

    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[268,494,1150,669]]]'>¶ 2. Mr. Heppner filed this divorce action in September of 2006, approximately two months after the parties separated. The Heppners have no children, and other than a clerical job before she married Mr. Heppner, a nine-month teaching stint in the 1974-1975 school year, and employment with a car dealership thereafter "for a couple [of] years," Ms. Heppner has not worked outside the home. Her college degree is in Geography and she let her teaching certificate lapse because, according to her testimony, she could not get a teaching job after her nine-month teaching contract was not renewed when the incumbent teacher whose place she took returned to the school.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[266,1185,1150,670]]]'>¶ 3. Ms. Heppner's health, which she described as "[fjragile," has not been good. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 and had a lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and currently sees an oncologist because, according to Ms. Heppner, "there's something suspicious" in her other breast. Additionally, Ms. Heppner told the trial court that she has "[sjpinal stenosis," painful trouble with her teeth and jaw, and herniated disks in her neck and lower back. She had a hysterectomy in 2001, and a subsequent laparoscopy a year before the divorce hearing because of, according to her testimony, "complications after the hysterectomy." She also takes a thyroid medicine.</p>

Mr. Heppner is in apparent good health and has done very well in his career, rising from low-level employment as a corporate accountant to be the president and chief executive officer of the storage and security division of Fortune Brands, which according to Mr. Heppner's testimony "is a large conglomerate, [with] about eight billion dollars in total sales." His <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>group within Fortune Brands encompasses Master Lock and "Waller Industries, which is Craftsman tool boxes if you went to Sears." There are some 3,500 employees in Mr. Heppner's group, and nine persons report to him directly. Mr. Heppner reports directly to the president and chief executive officer of Fortune Brands. Mr. Heppner received his masters of business administration degree in 1992, shortly after he left a previous employer, JI Case, which paid his business-school tuition. Mr. Heppner and his father paid for Mr. Heppner's undergraduate college degree.</p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[157,984,1155,881]]]'>¶ 5. Mr. Heppner testified that his job is very stressful and requires significant travel, both in the United States and abroad. He estimated that he spends some sixty percent of his time traveling, thirty percent of that travel being outside of the United States. He admitted, however, that he "wasn't always traveling 60 percent of the time," but that added responsibilities in 2006 brought it to that level. He told the trial court that he gets between eighty and one-hundred emails a day. Ms. Heppner described him as a "[wjorkaholic," and the trial court agreed. According to trial exhibits in the Record, Mr. Heppner earned a total of $1,521,212.66 in 2006, and $835,798.00 in 2007, both sums including base salary, incentive compensation, and exercised stock options. According to another trial exhibit in the Record, Mr. Heppner's net worth for the "Period Ending — Nov 12, 2007" was $2,379,301.69.</p>

Ms. Heppner testified that Mr. Heppner was OK with her not working outside the home once they were able to buy their first home, some two years after they married. Although Mr. Heppner disputed this, contending that he constantly asked her to work outside the home, either for pay or as a volunteer, the trial court found that Mr. Heppner agreed over the years <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>that his wife would not work and that he would retire sometime between the ages of fifty-five and sixty. This is how the trial court described in its oral decision what it called that "tradeoff': "That I [Mr. Heppner] get the benefit of my bargain, which is, I'm going to do this, you don't have to work, but I want to be able to get out from underneath the stresses of this position" by retiring early.</p>

"Fairness" has a special meaning under the law of maintenance: "We believe that a reasonable maintenance award is measured not by the average annual earnings over the duration of a long marriage but by the lifestyle that the parties enjoyed in the years immediately before the divorce and could anticipate enjoying if they were to stay married." <em>LaRocque, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=139%20Wis.%202d%2023" class="citation" data-index="17">139 </a><a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=139%20Wis.%202d%2023" class="citation" data-index="17">Wis. 2d at 36</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=406%20N.W.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="18">406 N.W.2d at 741</a>. Thus, the recipient spouse is entitled, assuming that the payor spouse's income permits it, to enjoy his or her life at the standard that he or she "could anticipate enjoying" but for the divorce. <em>See Hefty v. Hefty, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=172%20Wis.%202d%20124" class="citation" data-index="19">172 Wis. 2d 124</a>, 134, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=493%20N.W.2d%2033" class="citation" data-index="20">493 N.W.2d 33</a>, 37 (1992) (bolding in <em>Hefty). </em>When, of course, a recipient spouse could reasonably reach that life-style level by his or her own efforts following the expiration of a limited-term maintenance, then putting a time cap on the payment of maintenance may be appropriate. <em>Kenyon v.

As we have seen, the trial court found that Mr. and Ms. Heppner had a tacit agreement during their marriage, what the trial court referred to as the "bargain," that in return for Ms. Heppner not working outside the home, Mr. Heppner would retire by age sixty, if not a few years before. The trial court's selection of a fifty-percent division of Mr. Heppner's income for maintenance is consistent with Wisconsin law. <em>See Bahr v.

The trial court recognized that the Heppners "had a very long-term marriage," and found that the "tacit agreements" that Ms. Heppner would not work and that Mr. Heppner would retire early "were a part of the fabric" of their marriage. Further, no one seriously argued (despite Mr. Heppners off-the-wall opinion that Ms. Heppner had an earning capacity of $100,000 per year), and the trial court never found, that Ms. Hepp<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>ner, given her age, lack of work experience, and health problems could, at any point in the future, be self-supporting.

Despite this recognition of Ms. Heppner's expectations of what her lifestyle would be after Mr. Heppner retired, the trial court obliterated those expectations because it seemed to assume that it should cut off maintenance once Mr. Heppner retired because that would, for reasons the trial court did not explain and are not evident in the Record, cut off his sources of income.

It takes no special insight to recognize that whether the stock rebounds is largely, if not almost wholly, dependent on what the economy (and the housing segment) does before the options expire. The options were earned during the Heppners' marriage; they are part of the marital estate. The trial court's rationale for excluding them from the normal division of property does not wash. The trial court erroneously exercised its discretion by excluding the options from division because it erroneously viewed their potential value as being almost solely a function of what Mr. Heppner would do in his business after the divorce, and largely ignored the fact that the options were earned while the Heppners were married.
