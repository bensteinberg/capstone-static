This is a review of an unpublished decision of the court of appeals, which affirmed in part a judgment and order of the Circuit Court for Rock County, Daniel T. Dillon, Judge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Star Direct, Inc. d/b/a Star Distributing ("Star Direct") sued a former employee, Eugene Dal Pra ("Dal Pra"), for breach of two non-compete clauses. The "business clause" non-compete provision prohibited Dal Pra's engagement in a "substantially similar or competitive" business within his prior assigned sales territory. The "customer clause" non-compete provision barred Dal Pra from interfering with or endeavoring to entice away current and recent past customers for whom he had performed services, with whom he had dealt, or about whom he had obtained special knowledge over the course of his employment. The contract also contained a "confidentiality clause" that barred Dal Pra from <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>disclosing or using certain information such as confidential marketing techniques, customer lists, and trade secrets.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[166,557,1149,359]]]'>¶ 2. Both Dal Pra and Star Direct moved for summary judgment. The circuit court denied Star Direct's motion and granted Dal Pra's motion, concluding that all three restrictive covenants were unreasonable and therefore unenforceable. The circuit court also concluded that each one of the clauses was indivisible from the others.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[163,949,1152,516]]]'>¶ 3. The court of appeals agreed with the circuit court that the business clause was unenforceable. It also agreed that the business clause was indivisible from the customer clause, and thus both clauses were unenforceable. The court of appeals did not separately address the reasonableness of the customer clause, nor did it address the reasonableness of the confidentiality clause or its divisibility from the other clauses. <em>Star Direct, Inc. v.

The first set of issues relates to the enforceability of each of the three clauses — the business clause, the customer clause, and the confidentiality clause. The question for each is whether it is "reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer." <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20103.465" class="citation" data-index="0">Wis.

We conclude that the customer and confidentiality clauses are reasonably necessary to protect Star Direct and therefore enforceable. The business clause, however, is overbroad and unenforceable. We also hold that the customer and confidentiality clauses are divisible from the business clause and enforceable on their own terms. We thus affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the court of appeals, and remand this cause to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

Star Direct engages in the business of distributing assorted novelties and sundries<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> to convenience stores, service stations, truck stops, and travel centers throughout the Midwest. This business is competitive, and its business model is premised on the relationship between route salespeople and their customers. The route salespeople regularly visit customers and potential customers, work to understand their customer's business, and endeavor to build long-term personal and professional relationships with them.</p>

Dal Pra was a route salesperson employed by CB Distributors until his route was purchased, along with one other route, by Star Direct. Star Direct wished to retain the business on these routes, so it offered Dal Pra what he admitted was a "very good package." This employment offer included servicing a nearly identical route — the area within a 50-mile radius of Rockford, Illinois — as well as a $30,000 bonus upon the completion of 30 months of service. Dal Pra accepted the offer.</p>

One condition of Dal Pra's employment was the inclusion of three restrictive covenants in his employment contract prohibiting Dal Pra from certain post-termination activities. Two of the restrictive covenants are contained in separate paragraphs of Section II.D. of the employment contract, entitled "Non-Compete." A third restrictive covenant is contained in the immediately succeeding Section II.E., labeled "Confidentiality."</p>

The paragraph then continues with the following post-termination stricture:</p>

Dal Pra voluntarily quit his employment with Star Direct on August 11, 2006, and immediately began his own distribution company. It is undisputed, at least for purposes of our review on summary judgment, that Dal Pra's new company sold various products to convenience stores, gas stations, and truck stops within 50 miles of Rockford, Illinois, and that some of the convenience stores Dal Pra sold to were past and/or current customers of Star Direct.

We have interpreted this as establishing five prerequisites that a restrictive covenant must meet in order to be enforceable under Wisconsin law. A restrictive covenant must: (1) be necessary for the protection of the employer, that is, the employer must have a protectable interest justifying the restriction imposed on the activity of the employee; (2) provide a reasonable time limit; (3) provide a reasonable territorial limit; (4) not be harsh or oppressive as to the employee; and (5) not be contrary to public policy. <em>Lakeside Oil Co. v.

First, he argues that Star Direct has no legitimate protectable interest in prohibiting solicitation of past customers. Second, Dal Pra maintains that the provision unreasonably prohibits contact with customers — both current and past — whom Dal Pra may not have been in contact with for years. Third, he alleges that Star Direct's failure to systematically obtain restrictive covenants shows that they are not necessary for its protection. These objections are addressed to the first of the <em>Lakeside Oil </em>criteria, that is, whether the restrictions are necessary for Star Direct's protection. <em>Lakeside Oil, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=8%20Wis.%202d%20157" class="citation" data-index="24">8 Wis. 2d at 163</a>.

The record is clear that this was and is a fiercely competitive, relationship-based business. The customers he dealt with, then, were not simply buying product based on price or other objective factors.

As this brief review of the case law shows, Wisconsin courts and litigants have been untroubled by an employer's asserted interest in its recent past customers. While these cases do not settle the matter, the customer clause is distinguishable from these other cases only in that it expressly divided the customers into two identifiable groups — current and past customers. This brings the issue to the fore, and the question is does Star Direct have that interest vis-á-vis Dal Pra?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Star Direct does have an interest in prohibiting the solicitation of its recent past customers. First, Dal Pra obtained significant knowledge regarding Star Direct's business that could be used against Star Direct. If not prohibited, Dal Pra would be able to approach these customers with knowledge of Star Direct's prices and pricing strategies, proprietary marketing techniques, and profit margins. He would have all the information a competitor would want and need to know to effectively undercut Star Direct.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[194,916,1154,467]]]'>¶ 39. Second, through his employment and because of Star Direct's investment in him, Dal Pra would, as the customer clause so states, have serviced, dealt with, or have special knowledge about these customers. He would know their specific needs and product desires, and would have a relationship history with many of them. This would place him in a far better position than an ordinary competitor, and give him a distinct advantage.</p>

      <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>¶ 40. Finally, Star Direct does have a general interest in winning back the business of its recent past customers. The record shows this is a relationship-based and highly competitive business. It takes significant effort and investment to win customers. These past customers may have chosen to take their business elsewhere only temporarily, and would still have a history with Star Direct. While an employer's prospects of rekindling customer relationships fades considerably over 15 years (as in <em>Equity Enters., Inc. v. Milosch, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2001%20WI%20App%20186" class="citation" data-index="40">2001 WI App 186</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=247%20Wis.%202d%20172" class="citation" data-index="41">247 Wis. 2d 172</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=633%20N.W.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="42">633 N.W.2d 662</a>), we believe under the facts of this case that an employer is entitled to an opportunity to recoup the considerable investment of resources it made in developing and fostering customer relationships and business opportunities that were active as recently as one year prior to the employee's termination.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[227,1283,1153,568]]]'>¶ 41. For the reasons articulated above, Dal Pra would not simply be engaging in ordinary competition with Star Direct if permitted to interfere with recent past customers. He would have a distinct competitive advantage, and this advantage would be detrimental to Star Direct's business. We render no opinion as to how much time must pass between a customer placing an order and a route salesperson's termination before the employer no longer has a legitimate protectable interest in that customer.

In <em>Milosch, </em>the employer attempted to prohibit the employee for 18 months following termination from doing business with any customers of the employer with whom the employee had dealt during any portion of his 15-year employment, including customers who may have long ago transferred their business to competitors. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=633%20N.W.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="43">Id.,</a> </em>¶ 15 n.4.

The difference between <em>Milosch </em>and this case is that the customers in <em>Milosch </em>did not need to be recent or current customers at all; this makes all the difference. The court of appeals in <em>Milosch </em>specifically cited the customer whom Milosch could have serviced during the first weeks of his employment 15 years earlier who then took his or her business elsewhere. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=633%20N.W.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="45">Id.</a></em>

Contrary to Dal Pra's assertions, his special knowledge of customer needs, pricing, and profit margins means that there was real danger in him seeking Star Direct's current and past customers. The fact that he would not necessarily have had recent contact with those customers does not mean Star Direct has no legitimate interest. Even if Dal Pra was not the recent servicer of a customer, he would still have some relationship with that customer, important knowledge about that customer, or maybe most significantly, special knowledge about Star Direct's business and methods.</p>
    <p id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[227,967,1147,565]]]'>¶ 46. Dal Pra's employment contract provided unambiguous notice of the confidential "special knowledge" Dal Pra gained through his employment with Star Direct.

The record is clear that Star Direct substantially adjusted its business practices in 2002 when the new owner took over the company and began requiring all new route salespeople to sign restrictive covenants. The only route salespeople who do not have covenants not to compete are the five individuals who were employed before the current owner bought the company in 2002. As the owner stated, there was the obvious risk that the current employees would not sign them if asked to, or would leave and begin competing with Star Direct. In fact, employers may not compel their existing employees to sign restrictive covenants without additional consideration. <em>NBZ, Inc., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=185%20Wis.%202d%20827" class="citation" data-index="47">185 Wis. 2d at 837-39</a>.

The focal point of the dispute regarding the business clause is the "substantially similar" language. Star Direct argues that a "substantially similar" business is one that is, by definition, competitive. It even stated in oral argument that the phrase is possibly the result of an overzealous lawyer and should have been left out. Dal Pra responds that this approach turns the phrase "substantially similar" into pure surplusage.</p>

The disjunctive "or" plainly separates one from the other. A substantially similar business cannot refer to the same thing as a business "in competition with" Star Direct; nor would it be reasonable to read "substantially similar" as merely a subset of competitive activity as Star Direct urges. The only reasonable way to read the contract language giving meaning to every phrase is that it attempts to bar Dal Pra not only from competitive enterprises, but also from engaging in a business that is substantially similar to Star Direct's business yet not competitive.</p>

While having Dal Pra engage in a non-competitive substantially similar business might plausibly have some de minimus or insubstantial affects on Star Direct, the interests do not rise to the level of being reasonably necessary for its protection.

Dal Pra points to the statement in the contract defining the business of Star Direct as "the distribution of consumer products to service stations and/or convenience stores." The precise nature of a substantially similar business — what products Dal Pra could plausibly sell and not sell — is unnecessary to our determination, however.

The confidentiality clause of the employment contract consists of a single, convoluted paragraph beginning with an 18-line sentence containing 20 sub-clauses separated by 19 commas. Put gently, it is not a model of clarity. The confidentiality clause bars Dal Pra, for 24 months following his termination, from using or disclosing "any information or knowledge, known, disclosed or otherwise obtained by him during his employment by Employer or CB Distributors." It then lists a variety of specific information that is to be deemed confidential and protected, including but not limited to knowledge "conceived, discovered or developed by Employee or CB Distributors," "proprietary products or procedures," trade secrets, customer lists, "marketing techniques which are not generally known in the business community, and which relate to the business of the Employer or CB Distributors or are in the nature of trade or business secrets," mailing lists, and special pricing information.</p>

But this does not mean we make an effort to read a clause unreasonably in order to find the clause unreasonable and unenforceable against the employee.

All of the enumerated examples of protected information in the confidentiality clause are of a proprietary nature. This is important for at least two reasons. First, the inclusion of examples, particularly with modifiers indicating the confidential nature of the information, shows that the circuit court's interpretation is in error. For example, the modifier "proprietary" when discussing products and procedures would be rendered mere surplusage if the clause truly means "any information." Similarly, the clause prohibits the divulging of marketing techniques "not generally known in the business community." Again, this language would be surplusage under the circuit court's approach. Additionally, we think the confidential nature of the itemized examples indicates the true intent of the clause. The only reasonable construction of the clause considered in its totality is that it prohibits Dal Pra's use of confidential information of the type identified in the examples— information of a confidential and sensitive nature that, if made public or used by Dal Pra, would be deleterious to Star Direct's business. All of the itemized examples fit this general pattern.</p>

The employer <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>eventually conceded that the first provision was unreasonably broad in its territorial scope and therefore unenforceable. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20103.465" class="citation" data-index="67">Id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20103.465" class="citation" data-index="67">at 605, 607</a>.

This inquiry will be fact-intensive and depend on the totality of the circumstances.

Further, "If a competitor knew the prices that Star Distributing paid for its products, especially a competitor who was trying to 'get its foot in the door' with a customer, the competitor could quote a price to the customer which was very close to or even below Star Distributing's costs."
