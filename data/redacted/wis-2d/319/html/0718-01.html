Denton and Aubrey W Dahl (the defendants) appeal from judgments of conviction for attempted kidnapping, attempted false imprisonment, and party to the crime of attempted armed robbery. The defendants appeal from the trial court orders denying their motions for postconviction relief. They challenge (1) the trial court's admission of a computer generated animation, (2) the propriety of a kidnapping charge in addition to a robbery charge, and (3) the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions. We conclude that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion when it admitted a computer-generated exhibit created and presented by a police officer who was not an expert, and who possessed no firsthand knowledge of the facts depicted in the animation which purportedly illustrated the State's key witnesses' combined testimony of "what people did" during the alleged crime. We further conclude that the State has failed to carry its burden of proving that the trial court's error was harmless. We therefore reverse the judgments of conviction and the orders denying postconviction relief. We remand for further proceedings.</p>

On August 26, 2005, the State charged the defendants with one count of attempted armed robbery arising out of an incident which occurred on August 21, <a id="p723" href="#p723" data-label="723" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*723</a>2005. Following a preliminary hearing on November 23, 2005, the State filed an information charging the defendants with attempted armed robbery, attempted kidnapping with a weapon enhancer, and attempted false imprisonment with a weapon enhancer. The defendants were tried together on July 10 and 11, 2006.</p>

On August 21, 2005, at approximately 7:15 a.m., Walworth county dispatch advised officers of a 911 call of what appeared to be an attempted abduction. According to the victim, Judy Giovannoni, she was jogging northbound on Highway 67 on the west side of the road when a car, also heading north, pulled off on the east side of the road. A male (later identified as Dahl) exited the car and began running towards her saying something that she could not understand. Giovannoni then turned around and began running south when a second man (later identified as Denton) got out of the car and yelled words at her to the effect of "[G]et on the ground I have a f[uck]ing gun." Giovannoni then ran out on to the highway and a second vehicle stopped and let her enter the vehicle. They then turned around and followed the first vehicle. The driver of the second vehicle, Dennis Hohisel, called 911. They found the first vehicle in a ditch near Theater Road and Highway 67.</p>
    <p id="b823-5" data-blocks='[["BL_823.5",823,[188,1766,1152,464]],["BL_824.1",824,[248,385,1148,295]]]'>¶ 4. Hohisel testified that he was driving southbound on Highway 67 when he and his passenger observed a man in blue jeans and a white tank top (Denton) "chasing a woman down the side of the road on the west side of the road heading south. The woman was running frantically from the gentleman." Hohisel drove around him and observed the woman, later identified as Giovannoni, trying to flag them down. Hohisel let her get into the vehicle. When he looked in <a id="p724" href="#p724" data-label="724" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*724</a>his rearview mirror, he observed the same individual they had previously seen approaching their vehicle, and he appeared to hold a firearm in his hand. Hohisel's passenger, Leah Biever, also stated that she observed this individual with what appeared to be a handgun in his hand.</p>

Following a hearing on November 19, 2007, the trial court denied the defendants' postconviction motions. Additional facts relevant to the issues on appeal will be provided in the discussion.</p>

The defendants objected due to lack of sufficient notice to permit them to rebut the evidence, including retaining their own expert, and lack of accuracy. The defendants argued that it was "unduly prejudicial." After viewing the animation, the trial court commented:</p>

    <p id="b826-4" data-blocks='[["BL_826.4",826,[256,572,1152,780]]]'>The animation was presented by Officer Anthony Ambach, who first presented a computer-generated diagram reflecting the measurements he relied on in making the animation. The measurements had been taken by Clapper during a visit to the scene with Giovannoni. Ambach had not personally observed the scene, although he was familiar with the general area. The animation, which was based on "people's memories," was presented to the jury to "assist the jury in understanding directions, what people did, that sort of thing." Ambach, who was sequestered during the trial, based the animation upon his review of officers' reports and out-of-court discussions with Giovannoni, Hohisel, and Biever.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of what was depicted in the animation.</p>

At trial, Ambach played several versions of the animation, showing "all the key players" and the scene from different angles, including an overhead view and views from the vantage of both Giovannoni and Hohisel if they had been looking straight ahead. On cross-examination, Ambach acknowledged that if the animation differed from testimony given at trial, the animation would be an inaccurate depiction. Ambach agreed on cross that if Biever testified that Dahl was walking slowly, and the animation showed him running or jogging, that would not be accurate.</p>

On appeal, the defendants raise numerous challenges to the State's introduction of the computer-generated animation: (1) the State failed to disclose the computer-generated animation until the morning of the second and final day of trial; (2) the trial court failed to give any limiting or cautionary instruction to the jury explaining that the computer-generated animation was not evidence but only demonstrative of witness testimony; (3) the prosecutor essentially narrated the animation, thereby presenting unsworn, uncross-examined testimony to the jury; and (4) the State and trial court failed to preserve a copy of the animation used at trial. The defendants additionally argue that the particular facts of this case further warranted the exclusion of the animation: (1) the State failed to lay a proper foundation for the animation, (2) the animation presented improper hearsay and only depicted certain versions of the incident, and (3) Ambach failed to use proper methods and procedures in creating the animation. The State correctly points out that the objections preserved before the trial court were lack of notice, inaccuracy, undue prejudice and, arguably, lack of foundation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Therefore, we will limit our discussion to these grounds.</p>

The State contends, based on <em>Roy, </em>that it is not required to lay a foundation for a computer-generated animation in the same way that one is laid for a photograph or video. <em>See Peterson, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=222%20Wis.%202d%20449" class="citation" data-index="23">222 Wis. 2d at 452-56</a>.

Because Ambach was neither expert nor lay witness, and the video animation was not testified to as being either a fair and accurate representation or illustrative of any one witness's testimony, it had little probative value as a demonstrative exhibit, presented a very real danger of confusing and misleading the jury, and was unduly prejudicial to the defendants.</p>

Far from being an exhibit which merely illustrated a lay witness's testimony or an expert's opinion, this exhibit was nothing more than a collage of information — bits and pieces from each of the State's witnesses when, mixed together, effectively represented the police officer's own version of what occurred at the time and place in question. But the animator was not an eyewitness to the crime. His assessment about how the crime actually unfolded was just that, his collage, his assessment. By bringing this nonevidentiary perspective of the evidence to life by means of the computer-<a id="p737" href="#p737" data-label="737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*737</a>generated animation, and advising the jury that this was a representation of what happened, the jury was invited to view the collage as fact. A pasting of differing and sometimes conflicting facts from a mixture of witnesses, in an order that made most sense to the State, thus became the final, conclusive historical factual presentation of the crime. This is why it was unduly prejudicial. The animation superceded the sifting and winnowing that a jury normally does when fact witnesses describe the same event in varying and sometimes contradictory ways.</p>

First, Wisconsin law recognizes that a defendant may be prosecuted for kidnapping even when the kidnapping is incidental to another charged crime. <em>See Harris v. State, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=78%20Wis.%202d%20357" class="citation" data-index="36">78 Wis. 2d 357</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=254%20N.W.2d%20291" class="citation" data-index="37">254 N.W.2d 291</a> (1977), <em>criticized on other grounds by Wilson v.

Second, the defendants' attempt to narrow the definition of the "held to service" element of kidnapping to "forced labor, or involuntary servitude" ignores prior case law. The defendants acknowledge that in <em>State v. Clement, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=153%20Wis.%202d%20287" class="citation" data-index="42">153 Wis. 2d 287</a>, 293, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=450%20N.W.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="43">450 N.W.2d 789</a> (Ct. App. 1989), we held that "[t]he word 'service,' as it is used in [Wis. Stat. §] 940.31, includes acts done at the command of another." Although <em>Clement </em>set forth that definition while rejecting a defendant's contention that a kidnapping charge could not "be fulfilled by sexual <a id="p740" href="#p740" data-label="740" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*740</a>assault alone," the definition of "service" remains the same. <em>See Clement, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=153%20Wis.%202d%20287" class="citation" data-index="44">153 Wis. 2d at 292</a>.

The State argued to the trial court that it was "not trying to recreate the crime," and yet on appeal the State compares Ambach's role to a crime scene reconstructionist.

While the defense attempted to cross-examine Ambach based on certain discrepancies between witness testimony and details in the animation, Ambach lacked the ability to respond meaningfully. If, as in <em>Roy, </em>the animation was intended to depict Ambach's opinion, cross-examination could be an effective means of discrediting the witness and the content of the animation. <em>See Roy, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=305%20Wis.%202d%20658" class="citation" data-index="56">305 Wis. 2d 658</a>, ¶¶ 24-25 (cross-examination with respect to a demonstrative aid in an effort to impeach credibility of an expert witness can cure and eliminate prejudice). However, here, Ambach was not an expert who previously tendered his opinion and the bases for his opinion, nor did he have personal knowledge. We reject the State's contention that cross-examination provided an adequate means of addressing the admission of the animation in this case.</p>
