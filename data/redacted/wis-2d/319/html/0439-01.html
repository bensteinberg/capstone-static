Stat. § 111.92</a>(l)(a), without introducing a companion bill to specifically amend the Public Records Law, is sufficient to effect a change in that law. We so conclude because courts have jurisdiction to determine the meaning of statutes, here § 111.92(l)(a), and of constitutional provisions, here Article IY Section 17(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We also conclude that ratification of the collective bargaining agreement was insufficient to amend the Public Records Law because Article 2/4/4 of the collective bargaining agreement was not "introduce[d] in a bill or companion bills" within the meaning of § 111.92(1)(a), as that meaning is driven by the requirements of Article Pv( Section 17(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution. Accordingly, the ratification of the collective bargaining agreement did not create an exception to the Public Records Law.

Finally, we affirm the circuit court's application of the balancing test, which it appears the circuit court applied to the WSEU members as a group because that is how the issue was argued to the circuit court. However, we do not decide what our conclusion would be if, on remand, individual record subjects intervene and request the circuit court to apply the balancing test to them, individually.</p>

This case consists of two actions that were consolidated in the circuit court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> due to the identity of the legal issues presented. In the first case, Patrick Marley, a reporter from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Journal Sentinel), made an open records request to the Legislative Audit Bureau for the names of state employees who had been deactivated from the list of those permitted to drive state-owned vehicles. The Department of Administration (DOA) ultimately disclosed some of the requested names, but it refused to release the names of employees represented by WSEU. The DOA refused in part because of Article 2/4/4 of the <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>state's collective bargaining agreement with WSEU.

In the second case, Gregg Walker, an editor for the Lakeland Times, made an open records request to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for the salary information of DNR's employees working at its Rhinelander and Woodruff facilities. The DNR provided the names and salary information of 127 of the relevant employees, but withheld the names of 95 others. The employees whose names were withheld were represented by three Unions, one of which was WSEU. As <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>was the case in the first action, the DNR withheld the WSEU-represented employees' names pursuant to Article 2/4/4 of the collective bargaining agreement. In response, the Lakeland Times sued the DNR seeking mandamus to compel disclosure pursuant to <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2019.37" class="citation" data-index="5">Wis.

WSEU and other unions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> intervened, with WSEU's primary basis for intervening being the newspapers' challenge to the legal effect of Article 2/4/4 of the collective bargaining agreement. Since disclosure of the WSEU-represented employees' names in both cases depended on the legal effect of Article 2/4/4, the parties agreed to consolidate the actions.</p>
    <p id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[206,1084,1153,672]]]'>¶ 8. After consolidation, the newspapers and WSEU filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In resolving these motions, the circuit court focused on the following three issues: (1) whether the legislature's ratification of the collective bargaining agreement, without introducing companion legislation, amended the Public Records Law; (2) if not, whether <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.93" class="citation" data-index="6">Wis. Stat. § 111.93</a>(3) nevertheless caused Article 2/4/4 of the collective bargaining agreement to supersede the Public Records Law because precluding disclosure of the names of employees affected safety and therefore was a "condition of employment"; and (3) if not, whether the balancing test precluded disclosure.</p>
    <p id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[208,1778,1150,304]],["BL_552.1",552,[245,376,1146,245]]]'>¶ 9. The parties initially briefed and argued the first and second issues. On October 13, 2006, relying on the court of appeals' decision in <em>Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Wisconsin Personnel Commission, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=103%20Wis.%202d%20545" class="citation" data-index="7">103 Wis. 2d 545</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=309%20N.W.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="8">309 N.W.2d 366</a> (Ct. App. 1981), the circuit court concluded that the legislature's <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>ratification of the collective bargaining agreement, without enacting companion legislation expressly amending the Public Records Law as required by <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.92" class="citation" data-index="9">Wis.

    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[242,643,1150,722]]]'>¶ 10. The circuit court reasoned that ratification of the collective bargaining agreement was insufficient to amend the Public Records Law because the Joint Committee on Employment Relations (JCOER) did not comply with the requirements of <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.92" class="citation" data-index="10">Wis. Stat. § 111.92</a>(l)(a) that are necessary in order to amend an existing law. The court noted that § 111.92(l)(a) clearly requires JCOER to "introduce in a bill or companion bills ... that portion of the tentative [collective bargaining] agreement which requires legislative action for implementation, such as. . . any proposed amendments, deletions or additions to existing law." Because JCOER took no such action, the legislature did not create an exception to the Public Records Law.</p>
    <p id="b552-5" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[243,1378,1148,354]]]'>¶ 11. Regarding the second issue, the circuit court concluded that Article 2/4/4's prohibition on disclosure of the employees' names did not constitute a "condition of employment" under <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20111.93" class="citation" data-index="11">Wis.

Because the circuit court concluded that ratification of the collective bargaining agreement did not cause Article 2/4/4 to become an exception to the Public Records Law, the parties briefed and argued application of the balancing test. The circuit court granted the newspapers' motions for summary judgment. The circuit court concluded that the public interests favoring disclosure set forth in <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2019.32" class="citation" data-index="13">Wis.

This provision in the collective bargaining agreement conflicted with statutory provisions in Chapter 230 providing that a probationary employee had no right to appeal a discharge. The Joint Committee on Employment Relations had not introduced a bill containing that portion of the collective bargaining agreement that would amend or add to existing law by granting the Personnel Commission discretionary authority to review the discharge of probationary employees.</p>

Although the newspapers argue that the legislature has violated due process by not giving the public adequate notice of the contents of the Act, I am not persuaded by this argument, which has not generally been accepted by courts. A brief by an amicus also argues that the constitution has been violated by the legislature's singling out the press in the collective agreement, but this argument has not been advanced or discussed by any of the parties.</p>
