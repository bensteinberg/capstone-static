Michael Sveum challenges his aggravated stalking conviction. At Sveum's jury trial, the prosecution presented detailed tracking information about the movements of Sveum's car obtained from a Global Positioning System tracking device (GPS de<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>vice) that police secretly attached to his car. Sveum argues that the police obtained this tracking information in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The State responds that no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurs when police attach a GPS device to the outside of a vehicle while it is in a place accessible to the public and then use that device to track the vehicle while it is in public view. We agree with the State. At the same time, we urge the legislature to consider regulating both police and private use of GPS tracking technology.</p>

In 1999, from prison, he began stalking Johnson again with help from his sister. Sveum continued stalking Johnson when he was released from prison in 2002.

As part of their investigation, police sought and received a warrant authorizing them to covertly attach a GPS device to Sveum's car in order to track it.

Sveum challenges the admission of GPS tracking information showing the movements of his car. He argues that the warrant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> authorizing police to place the GPS device on his car was overly broad. The State responds that the warrant was unnecessary because no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurred. In <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>reply, Sveum implicitly concedes that placing the GPS device on his car and using it to monitor <em>public </em>travel does not implicate the Fourth Amendment. He contends, however, that because the GPS device permitted the police to monitor the location of his car while it was in his garage and in his employer's garage, places out of public view, all of the information obtained from the GPS device should have been suppressed. Because we agree with the State that no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurred, we do not address Sveum's warrant argument.</p>
    <p id="b608-3" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[252,921,1151,722]]]'>¶ 7. We begin with a recap of the pertinent facts. The batteiy-powered GPS device used here periodically receives and stores location information from one or more satellites. To obtain tracking information, the device must be physically retrieved and its information downloaded to a computer. The result is a detailed history, including time information, of the device's location and, hence, the vehicle's location. While Sveum's car was in his driveway, police secretly attached the device to the underside of his car with a magnet and tape. The police tracked Sveum's car with the device for about five weeks. During this time, Sveum parked his car in his enclosed garage and inside a garage at his place of employment, a car care center.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[250,1656,1149,301]]]'>¶ 8. We agree with the State that neither a search nor a seizure occurs when the police use a GPS device to track a vehicle while it is visible to the general public.

In <em>Knotts, </em>government agents planted a "beeper" — a radio transmitter emitting periodic signals that permit tracking with a radio receiver — inside a five-gallon drum. <em>See Knotts, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=460%20U.S.%20276" class="citation" data-index="3">460 U.S. at 277-78</a>.

The Court held that the monitoring of the beeper while the vehicle was in public view did not invade any legitimate expectation of privacy and, therefore, did not constitute a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=460%20U.S.%20276" class="citation" data-index="5">Id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=460%20U.S.%20276" class="citation" data-index="5">at 285</a>.

In contrast, a year later in <em>Karo, </em>the Court concluded that when police used a similar beeper planted in a similar container to determine how long the container remained at certain locations and to reveal the specific location of the container within a storage facility, a Fourth Amendment search occurred. <em>See Karo, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=468%20U.S.%20705" class="citation" data-index="11">468 U.S. at 708-10</a>, 717-18 &amp; n.5.

It follows that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred here simply because the police used a GPS device to obtain information about Sveum's car that was visible to the general public.</p>
    <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[254,1688,1149,302]]]'>¶ 12. We also agree with the State that the police action of attaching the GPS device to Sveum's car, either by itself or in combination with subsequent tracking, does not constitute a search or seizure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The State aptly relies on <em>United States v.

      <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>¶ 13. The <em>Garcia </em>court concluded that attaching a GPS device to a car while the car was in a public place did not convert the subsequent tracking into a Fourth Amendment search. <em>See <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=474%20F.3d%20994" class="citation" data-index="14">id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=474%20F.3d%20994" class="citation" data-index="14">at 996-98</a>.

Well, but the tracking in this case <em>was </em>by satellite. Instead of transmitting images, the satellite transmitted geophysical coordinates. The only difference is that in the imaging case nothing touches the vehicle, while in the case at hand the tracking device does. But it is a distinction without any practical difference.</blockquote>

Like the Seventh Circuit, we discern no privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment that is invaded when police attach a GPS device to the outside of a vehicle, as long as the information obtained is the same as could be gained by the use of other techniques that do not require a warrant.</p>
    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[199,1445,1150,412]]]'>¶ 14. Sveum might respond that, unlike <em>Garcia, </em>the police here did not attach the GPS device while his car was parked in a public place. However, the circuit court concluded that Sveum's driveway was not constitutionally protected "curtilage," and Sveum does not challenge this ruling or otherwise present a developed argument as to why the police engaged in a search or seizure by entering his driveway.</p>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.7",611,[199,1866,1150,194]]]'>¶ 15. Accordingly, we follow <em>Garcia's </em>lead and conclude that the attachment of a GPS device to Sveum's car does not change our view that, under <em>Knotts </em>and <em>Karo, </em>no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurred here.</p>
    <p id="b611-9" data-blocks='[["BL_611.9",611,[198,2135,1150,97]],["BL_612.1",612,[244,384,1153,100]]]'>¶ 16. Sveum argues that all of the tracking information should be suppressed because the GPS device <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>monitored the location of his car when it was out of public view. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>
    <p id="b612-3" data-blocks='[["BL_612.3",612,[244,490,1149,561]]]'>¶ 17. First, although the police presumably obtained location information while Sveum's car was inside areas not open to surveillance, there is no indication that this same information could not have been obtained by visual surveillance from outside these enclosures. Such surveillance could have told the police when Sveum's car entered or exited his garage and the garage at his workplace and, therefore, informed them when his car remained in those places. Sveum does not argue that the police used the GPS device to track his car's movements <em>within </em>the enclosures.</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[244,1126,1150,985]],["BL_613.1",613,[190,387,1151,90]]]'>¶ 18. Second, even if the police had obtained some information about the movement of Sveum's car within the enclosures and this information should have been suppressed, Sveum suggests no reason why <em>all </em>of the tracking information should be suppressed. Although we need not exhaustively analyze this issue, we note that properly obtained evidence is generally not excluded simply because a search is illegally extended to improperly obtain evidence. <em>See State v. Noll, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=116%20Wis.%202d%20443" class="citation" data-index="16">116 Wis. 2d 443</a>, 454-55, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=343%20N.W.2d%20391" class="citation" data-index="17">343 N.W.2d 391</a> (1984) ("Insofar as the searcher exceeds the scope of the validly authorized search, items so seized must be suppressed. However, as to those items discovered in the lawful execution of the valid part of the warrant, the Fourth Amendment does not require suppression."). Similarly, properly obtained and incriminating wiretap information is not suppressed solely because police also overhear unrelated private conversations that they would otherwise have no right to overhear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It is not apparent why a balancing of interests should not pro<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>duce the same rule when applied to the GPS tracking situation here.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[188,575,1152,535]]]'>¶ 19. Accordingly, we conclude that no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurs when police attach a GPS device to the outside of a vehicle while it is in a place accessible to the public and then use that device to track the vehicle while it is in public view. Because this case does not involve tracking information on the movement of Sveum's car within a place protected by the Fourth Amendment, it follows that the circuit court correctly rejected Sveum's Fourth Amendment suppression argument.</p>
    <p id="b613-6" data-blocks='[["BL_613.7",613,[190,1137,1151,472]]]'>¶ 20. We are more than a little troubled by the conclusion that no Fourth Amendment search or seizure occurs when police use a GPS or similar device as they have here. So far as we can tell, existing law does not limit the government's use of tracking devices to investigations of legitimate criminal suspects. If there is no Fourth Amendment search or seizure, police are seemingly free to secretly track <em>anyone's </em>public movements with a GPS device. As the Seventh Circuit observed:</p>
    <blockquote id="b614-3" data-blocks='[["BL_614.3",614,[332,382,1003,422]]]'>

Our research, based on the limited information referenced in the record, suggests that Sveum is relying on a Senate Report that accompanied the 1986 update to the federal act. The Report includes a preliminary "glossary," which defines "electronic tracking devices (transponders)" as Sveum's argument indicates. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 99-541, at *10 (1986). Sveum's reliance on this Senate Report, however, runs headlong into the express language of the enacted federal law, which broadly defines a "tracking device" as "an electronic or mechanical device which permits the tracking of the movement of a person or object." <em>See </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510" class="citation" data-index="32">18 U.S.C.S. § 2510</a>(12)(D) (incorporating the definition in <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203117" class="citation" data-index="33">18 U.S.C.S. § 3117</a>). Indeed, the Senate Report, in its "section-by-section" analysis of the act, references the same definition that appears in the enacted statutes. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 99-541, at *33-34. Sveum does not explain why the "glossary" definition in the Senate Report should control over this plain-language statutory definition, which obviously covers the GPS device used here.

Police were authorized to seize phone bills, journals, calendars, logs, computers and devices related to computers, cameras and film, binoculars, flashlights, ski masks, audio and/or video recording equipment in any format, and evidence that might identify the residents of the searched dwelling. Sveum also argues that the warrant lacked probable cause to seize some of the types of items identified in the warrant because he and his mother occupied the residence and the warrant lacked objective standards by which the executing officers could differentiate items his mother owned.

The legal basis for Sveum's argument is difficult to discern, but he relies on <em>State v. Alexander, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=214%20Wis.%202d%20628" class="citation" data-index="52">214 Wis. 2d 628</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=571%20N.W.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="53">571 N.W.2d 662</a> (1997), a case holding that a defendant's prior drunk driving convictions should not have gone to the juiy, even though proof of the prior convictions was necessary to prove the drunk driving charge at issue in that case.

We agree with the State's alternative argument that it would have been a reasonable strategic choice by counsel not to introduce evidence of the pending challenge to Sveum's 1996 conviction because the prosecutor would have countered with damaging proof that Sveum's direct appeal from the 1996 conviction had failed.</p>

At trial, Johnson, the stalking victim, provided strong testimony against Sveum, such as her assertion that, during one encounter in 1994, Sveum grabbed her and told her that one day when she came home he would be hiding in the bushes and would blow her head off. Sveum argues that it was, therefore, critical to impeach Johnson's credibility and that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance when counsel failed to use information Sveum provided to cross-examine Johnson. For example, Sveum says he advised his counsel about police reports proving that Johnson had voluntary contacts with him after the alleged threat, and that counsel failed to use this information to impeach Johnson.</p>
    <p id="b625-8" data-blocks='[["BL_625.8",625,[201,2092,1150,150]],["BL_626.1",626,[242,396,1148,557]]]'>¶ 50.

But, just as the <em>Thiel </em>court concluded that the failure to use such information to impeach the victim, standing alone, did not undermine the court's confidence in the outcome, <em>see id., </em>¶ 81, we similarly conclude that the failure does not undermine our confidence in the jury's verdict here.</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[237,972,1151,870]]]'>¶ 51. We agree with the circuit court that, given the long history of Sveum's stalking conduct toward Johnson, attempts to impeach Johnson as Sveum suggests could easily have backfired. Moreover, much of the information Sveum relies on could have been readily explainable, and none of it would have been likely to have destroyed Johnson's credibility or made her seem less credible than Sveum. Sveum chose not to testify and, even assuming he had, it strains credulity to think the jury would have found him more credible than Johnson. The evidence at trial, which included Sveum's sister's testimony and correspondence between Sveum and his sister, showed that Sveum was highly deceptive and manipulative. Accordingly, Sveum has not shown deficient performance or prejudice based on counsel's failure to cross-examine Johnson with the information identified.</p>

On redirect, the State asked Renee if she knew that Sveum had threatened to blow Johnson's head off, and Renee replied, "no." Sveum argues that, because Renee was the first witness to testify and Johnson had not yet testified about Sveum's threat, counsel was ineffective by failing to object for lack of foundation. This argument is meritless. Although it appears to be true that the question lacked a foundation when asked because Johnson had yet to testify, we agree with the State that the same question could have been posed to Sveum's sister either by recalling her after Johnson testified or by permitting the question in hypothetical form because it was known that Johnson would testify about the death threat.</p>

Thus, this statute requires an instruction when one is <em>requested. </em>The logical corollary is that an instruction is not required every time evidence is admitted for one purpose, but is not admissible for another, and, therefore, it is not <em>per se </em>deficient performance to fail to request an instruction.</p>

This evidence demonstrated not only that Sveum was engaging in prohibited phone contacts, but that he was also maintaining visual or physical proximity to Johnson on a recurring basis. Moreover, with exceptions not relevant here, Sveum's trial counsel did not attempt to persuade the jury that Sveum did not engage in the conduct alleged after he was released from prison. Rather, counsel disputed other elements. Counsel candidly stated in closing argument: "[Y]ou're asked to take a course of conduct <em>which obviously is present </em>and still decide if what happened here is stalking." (Emphasis added.)
