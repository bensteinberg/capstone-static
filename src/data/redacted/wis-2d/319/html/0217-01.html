    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[565,901,370,37]]]'>BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[175,995,1155,569]]]'>¶ 2. The undisputed facts come from the suppression hearing testimony. On December 28, 2006, City of Racine Police Officers Michael Dummer and Joseph Spaulding were on patrol as part of the Community Oriented Policing Unit, a unit that deals with, among other things, street-level drug offenders. Both officers had at least five years' experience with the department. At approximately 6:20 p.m., the officers noticed a vehicle being operated with defective brake lamps. The officers initiated a traffic stop, and the driver, Bridges, promptly complied by stopping his vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[176,1574,1150,363]]]'>¶ 3. The traffic stop occurred in "not such a good area" of town where the police had received numerous complaints of gunshots fired at night. The area, across the street from a bar, was typically deserted at night. There was artificial lighting, but the area was nonetheless not well-lit. Due to the location, and the fact that Bridges had a passenger, the officers called for back-up.</p>
    <p id="b321-7" data-blocks='[["BL_321.7",321,[175,1943,1150,150]],["BL_322.1",322,[241,373,1147,307]]]'>¶ 4. After Bridges pulled over to the curb, the officers saw him make a questionable movement. Dummer testified that he observed Bridges lean "back and <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>over, over the console of the vehicle and he was reaching toward his left side of his body." To Dummer, it looked like Bridges was reaching toward his "lower area body parts" — "jacket pocket, pants pocket," so as to give himself room to get into his left pocket. Dummer explained:</p>
    <blockquote id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[315,724,998,455]]]'>I know from my past experience that most people keep their wallets in their backside not their front side and he was reaching to his front side especially his left side which is not a strong hand side so it made me more aware of what he was possibly doing on his left side. There was also a lot of people who I have had contact with conceal weapons under their left leg [because] it's closer to the door side. So as they're leaning over towards the window, they can reach and access their firearm or knife or whatever it may be.</blockquote>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[238,1222,1151,560]]]'>As a result of this experience, Dummer viewed Bridges' movement toward his front left side as consistent with, among other things, obtaining or concealing a dangerous weapon. Spaulding testified that he also saw Bridges lean back and make a shoving motion, and that this motion caused him to be concerned: "I know when I see that motion, that they're trying to conceal something illegal... and it usually is a weapon or controlled substances." Immediately, the officers spoke with one another about the movement that they had just witnessed.</p>
    <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.6",322,[238,1801,1154,411]],["BL_323.1",323,[180,378,1148,151]]]'>¶ 5. Dummer approached the driver's side of Bridges' vehicle and asked him for identification to "see what kind of movements he would make," but did not see any additional movement. Dummer took Bridges' identification and stepped to the rear of the car, where he talked with Spaulding about removing Bridges from his vehicle — all the while observing Bridges. Dummer then asked Bridges about the movement that he had <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>observed at the onset of the traffic stop, but Bridges gave no explanation. Bridges has not disputed the accuracy of the officers' description of his movement.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[179,548,1151,833]]]'>¶ 6. Given the location and the fact that back-up had not yet arrived, Dummer had Bridges step outside of his vehicle, so that he could better "see [Bridges'] movements and make sure that [his] safety as well as [his] partner's safety [was] at its best situation." Dummer handcuffed Bridges, assuring him that the handcuffs were for safety purposes, and not because he was under arrest. Dummer then informed Bridges that he wanted to perform a pat-down to feel for any dangerous weapons. Before beginning the pat-down search, Dummer asked Bridges whether he had anything on his person that could cause injury or any other illegal item; Bridges said that he did not. During the search, Dummer found cocaine ánd over two hundred dollars. Dummer then issued Bridges a citation for operating a vehicle with defective brake lamps.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[180,1400,1149,359]]]'>¶ 7. Bridges was charged with one count of Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Deliver (between five and fifteen grams) pursuant to <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20961.41" class="citation" data-index="1">Wis.

The requested backup had not arrived, and the initial reason that Bridges was stopped had not been resolved before the protective search took place. Both officers witnessed Bridges make a movement consistent with obtaining or concealing a weapon. These officers, each with over five years' experience in law enforcement, believed that Bridges may have been armed: Bridges was reaching toward his left front side, where a license or wallet is not usually kept, and Dummer had experience with "a lot of people" who concealed weapons under their left leg close to the car door. Spaulding recognized the shoving motion as consistent with an attempt to conceal a weapon or contraband.</p>

Moreover, the present case is unlike <em>Johnson </em>because, before performing the protective search, Dummer questioned Bridges regarding the suspicious movement, and Bridges did not respond. Bridges' failure to provide an explanation effectively transformed what Bridges now maintains was an innocent movement into a specific, articulable fact supporting a reasonable suspicion that Bridges posed a threat to the officers' safety.</p>

The traffic stop of Bridges took place in a poorly lit, deserted area where gunfire was frequently heard at night, and the backup had not yet arrived. Both officers believed that Bridges may be armed based on their observations of his movements and their experience in law enforcement. Dummer took the minimally intrusive step of questioning Bridges to obtain information to confirm or dispel their suspicions. Bridges' failure to answer, combined with the totality of circumstances, gave rise to "a reasonably prudent [officer's] . . . belief that his [or her] safety.. . was in danger." <em>See Johnson, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=299%20Wis.%202d%20265" class="citation" data-index="40">299 Wis. 2d 265</a>, ¶ 21 (citation omitted).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
