The Redevelopment Authority of the City of Milwaukee seeks review of a published decision of the court of appeals reversing a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Elsa C. Lamelas, Judge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The judgment of the circuit court was that the Redevelopment Authority is not obligated under Article I, Section 13 of the Wisconsin Constitution to pay any sum to the City of <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>Milwaukee Post No. 2874 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States as just compensation for the taking of a parcel of real property in which the VFW held a leasehold interest. The judgment also required the VFW to return a $300,000 award that it had previously received from the Redevelopment Authority and to pay $87,348 in interest and statutory costs.</p>
    <p id="b657-4" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[195,765,1154,321]]]'>¶ 2. The court of appeals reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause to the circuit court, instructing that "the VFW must be afforded an opportunity to prove the value of its separate leasehold interest" in the condemned property and to receive compensation therefor.</p>

The circuit court applied the "unit rule" in determining the amount that the Redevelopment Authority had to pay the VFW as just compensation for the taking. Under the unit rule, when property that is held in partial estates by multiple owners is condemned, the condemnor pays the fair market value of an undivided interest in the property rather than the fair market <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>value of each owner's partial interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Apportionment of the total sum awarded is then made among the owners.

    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[186,503,1154,482]]]'>¶ 5. A jury found that the undivided interest in the property condemned in the present case by the Redevelopment Authority had no value at the time of the taking. In accordance with the unit rule and with the jury's verdict, the circuit court entered a judgment declaring that the VFW is not entitled to receive any compensation from the Redevelopment Authority and must reimburse the Redevelopment Authority for money paid to it.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[187,1010,1155,700]],["BL_660.1",660,[244,376,1146,153]]]'>¶ 6. The VFW contends that because the terms of its lease agreement were exceedingly favorable ($1 a year rent for a renewable 99-year term), the VFW's leasehold interest in the condemned property had value notwithstanding the property's lack of value. The VFW argues that under the circumstances of the present case, the unit rule operates to deprive it of just compensation contrary to Article I, Section 13 of the Wisconsin Constitution. The VFW thus challenges the circuit court's judgment on the ground that the circuit court improperly instructed the jury to determine just compensation according to the unit rule. The VFW urges the court to apply the "separate valuation" (or "indepen<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>dent valuation") rule in the present case in lieu of the unit rule to determine the fair market value of the condemned property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[243,555,1150,578]]]'>¶ 7. We state the issue on review as follows: If the VFW, which holds a long-term favorable lease, receives no compensation for its leasehold interest under the unit rule, has the VFW's right to just compensation under Article I, Section 13 of the Wisconsin Constitution been violated? In other words, the court is asked to determine whether the application of the unit rule in the present case violates the just compensation clause when the fair market value of the property is zero, rendering the VFW entitled to $0 for the loss of its property interest as a lessee.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[242,1168,1149,477]]]'>¶ 8. We conclude that using the unit rule in the present case to value the whole property to determine the amount of compensation due to the VFW does not violate the just compensation clause. We conclude that the VFW receives just compensation when it receives no compensation for its leasehold interest in a property that has no value. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals reversing the judgment of the circuit court. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[240,1672,1151,206]],["BL_661.1",661,[192,391,1149,97]]]'>¶ 9. Inquiring minds might ask how the property at issue in the instant case can be worth nothing. The property is located in the heart of the City of Milwaukee. Even if the building is worthless, isn't the land <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>worth something, and doesn't the VFW as a lessee have an interest in the land upon which the hotel stands?</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.4",661,[192,500,1151,666]]]'>¶ 10. The answer is that the property as a whole is worth nothing because it is financially infeasible to use the property either by remodeling the hotel building or by demolishing the building to get at the unimproved land. An appraiser testified (and the jury apparently accepted) that the cost of remodeling the building to make it usable would be more than the fair market value of the building and land. Furthermore, the appraiser testified, and the jury again apparently accepted, that although the unimproved land does have value, the value of the land in an undeveloped state is exceeded by the cost of demolishing the building to render the land vacant.</p>

The Redevelopment Authority and the VFW have been parties to numerous proceedings relating to the Redevelopment Authority's taking of the property at issue. Many of these proceedings are not directly within the scope of our review and are not fully documented in the circuit court record in the present case. We do not offer a comprehensive account of the history underlying this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We briefly state the facts and refer to prior proceedings as relevant to the issue on review.</p>
    <p id="b662-3" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[235,393,1152,372]]]'>
      <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>¶ 12. The VFW owned a parcel of real property-situated at 2601 West Wisconsin Avenue in the City of Milwaukee that is the subject of the condemnation. It used this property as its headquarters. In 1961, the VFW conveyed the real estate (land and improvements) to Towne Metropolitan, Inc., which built an 11-story, 113,000-square-foot hotel on the land.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.7",662,[233,791,1148,368]],["BL_663.1",663,[184,389,1149,307]]]'>¶ 13. In exchange for conveying the real estate, the VFW obtained a 99-year lease for 5,250 square feet on the hotel's ground floor, was amounting to 4.6 percent of the building. The lease provided that the VFW's space in the hotel would be designed for the VFW's purposes and that all leasehold improvements and equipment would be furnished by the lessor. It <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>further provided that the lessor would pay all real estate taxes and would provide heat, air conditioning, maintenance, and periodic redecoration at no cost to the VFW. The lease obligated the VFW to pay an annual rent of only $1 and was renewable for a second 99-year term at the VFW's option.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[184,710,1156,517]]]'>¶ 14. Under the lease, the VFW was vulnerable, however, to complete loss. The lease was subordinate to any mortgage against the building, allowing a lender to foreclose and wipe out the lease. The VFW's interest reverted to the lessor when the VFW ceased to occupy the building. The lessor had no duty to assure that in the event of eminent domain the building would have adequate value to compensate the VFW for the value of its lease. The lease was silent regarding allocation of the proceeds of condemnation.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[186,1241,1151,516]]]'>¶ 15. Towne Metropolitan sold the real estate in 1986 to Marquette University, which used the hotel as a dormitory. In 1994, Marquette University sold the real estate to Maharishi Vedic University for $600,000. With each sale of the property, the VFW's lease was assigned to the new owner, who had the responsibility of complying with the VFW's lease. Maharishi Vedic University never occupied the hotel after purchasing it but continued to provide utilities and maintenance for the VFW's space.</p>
    <p id="b663-6" data-blocks='[["BL_663.6",663,[188,1772,1151,462]],["BL_664.1",664,[245,391,1146,101]]]'>¶ 16. Although the premises rented by the VFW apparently remained in habitable condition, by the 1990s the hotel as a whole had deteriorated, along with the surrounding neighborhood. In February 1998, the Redevelopment Authority held a public hearing to consider creating a redevelopment district in an area including the real estate at 2601 West Wisconsin Avenue. In January 1999 the Redevelopment Authority created a redevelopment district and issued a relocation <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>order. The Department of Commerce approved the Redevelopment Authority's relocation plan in May 1999.</p>

In January 2001, the Redevelopment Authority issued a jurisdictional offer to purchase the real estate at 2601 West Wisconsin Avenue, including the hotel and any other improvements, as well as an adjoining parking lot owned exclusively by Maharishi Vedic University. After locating comparable properties, the Redevelopment Authority made a jurisdictional offer in the amount of $440,000 as compensation for (1) land and improvements (with the VFW and Maharishi Vedic University as owners), (2) personal property in the hotel owned by Maharishi Vedic University, and (3) an adjoining parking lot owned solely by Maharishi Vedic University.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The Redevelopment Authority filed a $440,000 award of damages with the clerk of courts for Milwaukee County in February 2001. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Michael E Sullivan, Judge, divided the $440,000 award between the VFW and Maha<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>rishi Vedic University. The VFW received $300,000, less taxes owing. Maharishi Vedic University received $140,000, less taxes owing.</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[187,551,1155,675]]]'>¶ 20. The VFW appealed the adequacy of the award to the Condemnation Commission in February 2002. Maharishi Vedic University did not join in the appeal. The Condemnation Commission requested instruction from the circuit court about how to value the property. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Michael E Sullivan, Judge, ordered the Condemnation Commission to determine the value of the property for just compensation according to the unit rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Commission determined that the Redevelopment Authority was obligated to pay $425,000 in compensation— $15,000 less than the Redevelopment Authority had provided in its award.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[191,1242,1152,402]]]'>¶ 21. The VFW appealed the decision of the Condemnation Commission to the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County. In a pretrial motion, the VFW urged the circuit court not to apply the unit rule when determining the amount of just compensation. The VFW argued that under the circumstances of the present case, application of the unit rule would violate Article I, Section 13 of the Wisconsin Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[192,1671,1149,149]],["BL_666.1",666,[256,384,1148,517]]]'>¶ 22. The VFW contended that its leasehold interest was extremely valuable because the rent was only $1 per year. One estimate was that the value of the lease<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>hold to the VFW was approximately $50,000 a year. The VFW's appraiser estimated the fair market value of the VFW's leasehold interest at the date of taking, reduced to present value, as approximately $1,200,000, an amount "sufficient to build a facility with 5,250 square feet and maintain it without occupancy costs over the remaining period of the lease."<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The VFW also argued that it should not be obligated to prove the value of the building that it did not own and did not have an obligation to maintain.</p>

The matter then went to a jury trial for a determination of the fair market value of the property taken by the Redevelopment Authority.</p>

The Redevelopment Authority and the VFW both presented professional appraisers who testified at trial regarding the value of the property.

    </p>
    <p id="b667-5" data-blocks='[["BL_667.5",667,[197,917,1152,622]]]'>¶ 25. The appraisers agreed that a buyer could not extract value from the property by demolishing the hotel structure and starting over with vacant land. The Redevelopment Authority's appraiser testified that the land would be worth about $285,000 if vacant and that it would cost more than $1,000,000 to demolish the hotel building, including $864,000 for asbestos removal. The VFW's appraiser agreed that the land would be worth about $300,000 if vacant, that demolishing the building would mean spending about $850,000 on asbestos removal, and that a prospective owner likely would not be interested in tearing the building down.</p>

He specifically concluded that it would not be financially feasible to renovate the hotel building for use as a retail outlet, an office building, an apartment building, a dormitory, an educational facility, a subsidized housing unit, a full-service hotel, or a hmited-service hotel. He concluded that when put to each use, the land and hotel structure would have a negative value because the cost of necessary renovations would outweigh any profits that the property could be expected to yield.</p>

The VFW's appraiser testified that the hotel building could be renovated and put to a use falling within the "general residential" category. His testimony and written report suggested that the building could be renovated and used as an apartment complex, a housing complex for the elderly, a homeless shelter, a mental health facility, a halfway house, or a limited-service hotel. The VFW's appraiser admitted, however, that he had not determined whether any of his proposed uses would be financially feasible.</p>
    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[246,1481,1148,360]]]'>¶ 29. The appraisers provided dramatically different estimates of the property's total worth. The Redevelopment Authority's appraiser testified that the property had zero market value, because a buyer would be unable to make any money with the property either by razing or renovating the hotel building. The VFW's appraiser fixed the property's value at approximately $1,800,000.</p>

The circuit court concluded that the latter figure was the correct assessed value at the time of the taking.</p>

The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Maxine A. White, Judge, granted the application. The VFW appealed to the court of appeals, but in the interim a different circuit court judge approved an order requiring the Redevelopment Authority to raze the building at 2601 West Wisconsin Avenue. The court of appeals concluded that the VFW's challenge to the writ of assistance had become moot by virtue of the raze order. <em>See City of Milwaukee Post No. 2874 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. v.

The VFW, once the owner of the prime real estate at issue here, conveyed the property to another in exchange for a 99-year lease with annual rent due of $1. For that $1, the VFW obtained 5,250 square feet of space with no obligations to pay for taxes, utilities, maintenance, or even redecoration costs. Because of acts outside of the VFW's control, the building fell into a state of disrepair such that the city of Milwaukee condemned the property, which eventually led to the eviction of the VFW. The <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>VFW claimed its interest in the property was $1.8 million, but pursuant to the unit rule, the VFW was unfortunately left with no money for its interest in the property.

The unusual circumstances of this case, culminating in zero payment for the taking of an 11-story building on historic Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee, as well as the termination of a valuable leasehold interest in that building, cry out for an exception to the "unit rule" because of the grossly unjust result that it visits upon the leaseholder. The majority will hear none of it. Indeed, the majority seizes the opportunity presented by this case to (1) disavow existing exceptions to the unit rule in Wisconsin law; <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>(2) minimize Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and the Wisconsin cases citing his landmark decision in <em>Boston Chamber of Commerce v.

The VFW was the sole owner of a parcel of real property situated on the south side of Wisconsin Avenue at 26th Street in downtown Milwaukee. In 1961, the VFW conveyed its land with improvements to Towne Metropolitan (Towne), a real estate development company that planned to construct a large hotel on the site. In return for the conveyance of its property, the VFW obtained a 99-year lease for 5,250 square feet on the ground floor of the new hotel. This lease contained an option to renew for another 99 years. It also provided that the VFW's space would be designed for VFW purposes and that all leasehold improvements and equipment would be furnished by the lessor. In addition, the annual rent was to be only $1.00, and the lessor would pay all real estate taxes, heating, air conditioning, and maintenance costs, and would redecorate the premises every seven years.</p>
    <p id="b701-6" data-blocks='[["BL_701.6",701,[194,2011,1151,253]]]'>¶ 94. The terms of this lease were honored by Towne when the 11-story hotel was operated by Hilton Hotels, and later Holiday Inn, and then honored by Marquette University (Marquette), which acquired the property in 1986.</p>

In 1994, Marquette sold the property, which was being used for student housing, to the Maharishi Vedic University (the Maharishi) for $600,000. The Maharishi never occupied the property.</p>
    <p id="b702-4" data-blocks='[["BL_702.4",702,[256,720,1151,930]]]'>¶ 96. One of the major fact questions in this case is why the Maharishi never occupied the building. Counsel for the Redevelopment Authority explained that the new owner was never given occupancy permits, presumably because the building had building code violations. Counsel for the VFW asserted that the City of Milwaukee refused to act on repeated demands by the VFW that the City enforce the building code against the new owner. Instead, the City simply continued to assess and tax the property at a value near the 1994 purchase price, while the Redevelopment Authority sent signals of its intention to condemn the property as part of an urban redevelopment project. In February 1998, the Redevelopment Authority held a public hearing to consider creating a redevelopment district, and after the hearing, it issued a relocation order. All these factors contributed to the deterioration of the building and its eventual abandonment by the Maharishi.</p>

Stat. § 32.05</a>(9). The Maharishi did not join this appeal, having accepted an award of $140,000, less delinquent taxes. After litigation to determine how the Commission should value the property, the Commission valued the total property, using a strict application of the unit rule, at $425,000; that is, $15,000 less than the Redevelopment Authority's jurisdictional offer. This award was made in December 2004.</p>
