This is a review of a published decision of the court of appeals<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> affirming the entry of summary judgment against Joseph Donaubauer ("Donaubauer") by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Francis Wasielewski, Judge. This case is a dispute between an insurer and an insured over the proper replacement value of a home that had burned down. Donaubauer, the homeowner, challenges the validity and outcome of an appraisal award determining the replacement value of the home.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.8",157,[164,1097,1150,361]]]'>¶ 2. Three issues concern us today. First, did the circuit court err when it compelled Donaubauer to participate in the binding appraisal process? Second, should the appraisal award be vacated or modified? Third, did the circuit court err in denying Donaubauer's request to depose the appraiser and a third party contractor who assisted in the appraisal process?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We hold that the circuit court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in enforcing the agreement between the parties to participate in the binding appraisal process. We also hold that the circuit court properly affirmed the appraisal award because there was no evidence that the appraisers engaged in fraud, bad faith, material mistake, or that they lacked understanding of their contractually assigned task. Finally, <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>we hold that the circuit court did not erroneously exercise its discretion when it denied Donaubauer the opportunity to conduct discovery into the appraisal process. For these reasons, the holding of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[645,721,389,36]]]'>I. BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[265,820,1150,315]]]'>¶ 4. On April 15, 2003, Joseph Donaubauer's home located at 9277 South Pennsylvania Avenue in Oak Creek, Wisconsin was completely destroyed by a fire. Apparently, sparks from a Union Pacific train running near Donaubauer's home started a grass fire that spread to his property.</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[265,1159,1148,252]]]'>¶ 5. Donaubauer had purchased a homeowner's insurance policy from The Farmers Automobile Insurance Association ("Farmers")<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> with a policy period running from October 1, 2002, through October 1, 2003. The policy had several different types of coverage.</p>
    <p id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.7",158,[262,1435,1156,566]],["BL_159.1",159,[170,377,1150,89]]]'>¶ 6. First, Donaubauer's policy contained a "Dwelling" coverage for which he received $301,350. This payment consisted of the full $287,000 limit of liability under this coverage, plus five percent for debris removal. Donaubauer also had "Personal Property" coverage. Farmers paid the full limit of $172,200 for this coverage. Third, Donaubauer's policy had "Loss of Use" coverage for which Farmers paid an additional $57,400 —again the full limit for that policy coverage. Thus, apart from the coverage for replacement value at issue in this case, Farmers paid Donaubauer approximately <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>$530,950 for claims relating to his home burning down.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[168,485,1154,308]]]'>¶ 7. The coverage Donaubauer purchased also included a "Home Guard Endorsement" (hereafter, the "Policy"). The Policy provided additional coverage above the $287,000 "Dwelling" limit if the cost to replace the home was more than this amount. Several provisions of the Policy are relevant to this dispute.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[169,802,1148,205]]]'>¶ 8. The Policy defines "replacement value" as "the current cost at time of loss, without deduction for depreciation, to replace the damaged, destroyed or stolen property with articles of like kind and quality."</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.6",159,[168,1015,1149,359]]]'>¶ 9. In order to receive benefits under the Policy, the contract provided: "You agree to .. .

    <p id="b159-7" data-blocks='[["BL_159.7",159,[168,1384,1149,95]]]'>¶ 10. The Policy also contained what we will call the "appraisal clause." It states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b159-8" data-blocks='[["BL_159.8",159,[239,1507,1007,275]],["BL_160.1",160,[336,379,1003,366]]]'>
      <em>Appraisal. </em>If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the residence premises is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to an umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of loss.</blockquote>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[261,792,1149,459]]]'>¶ 11. After his home burned down, Donaubauer submitted a claim under the Policy. Donaubauer then obtained an estimate for the replacement value of his home of approximately $553,000. In June 2003, Farmers obtained its own estimate of the replacement value; it totaled $380,819. Donaubauer argued that this offer was substantially below the true replacement value, and in the latter part of 2003, Farmers increased its offer to $471,000.</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[259,1264,1154,410]]]'>¶ 12. On April 12, 2004, Donaubauer filed suit in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> alleging that Farmers refused to pay him the replacement value of the home pursuant to the terms of the Policy. His claims included misrepresentation, bad faith, and breach of contract. Farmers responded that they had no obligation to pay under the Policy until Donaubauer actually replaced his home, which he had not done.</p>
    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.6",160,[258,1687,1149,198]]]'>¶ 13. Litigation regarding Donaubauer's contract claims ensued. On January 24, 2005, Donaubauer obtained another estimate for the cost of rebuilding his home, this time for $720,309.</p>
    <p id="b160-7" data-blocks='[["BL_160.7",160,[259,1896,1147,98]],["BL_161.1",161,[176,386,1155,728]]]'>¶ 14. On March 22, 2005, Farmers sent a letter to Donaubauer raising several issues. Farmers stated that <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>the Home Guard Endorsement was clear that disbursement under the Policy was contingent upon Donaubauer actually repairing or replacing the dwelling. Farmers also asserted that the lawsuit violated the Policy and demanded resolution of the disagreement over the replacement value via the process outlined in the Policy's appraisal clause. Farmers stated that the Policy's appraisal clause, once invoked, was binding on the parties. Farmers also named its designated appraiser pursuant to the appraisal clause, and requested that Donaubauer designate his appraiser. Finally, Farmers stated that if Donaubauer "disagrees with the analysis set forth herein," he should respond in writing with "the legal and factual basis for the disagreement."</p>
    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[177,1128,1150,463]]]'>¶ 15. On March 25, 2005, Donaubauer sent a reply letter stating that he understood Farmers was requesting an appraisal and that he had to respond within 20 days (per the Policy). Donaubauer had recently had surgery, however, so he requested that Farmers toll the 20 day requirement until Donaubauer's doctor determined he was healthy enough to continue with the litigation. Farmers promptly responded by letter and granted Donaubauer's request.</p>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[176,1605,1151,410]]]'>¶ 16. On May 12, 2005, Donaubauer's attorney called the attorney for Farmers and informed him that Donaubauer was close to recovery, and that Donaubauer had agreed to the appraisal process referenced in the previous correspondence. Farmers' attorney confirmed this conversation by letter that same day, requesting that Donaubauer select his appraiser when he was sufficiently well.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[175,2032,1149,202]],["BL_162.1",162,[252,381,1146,152]]]'>¶ 17. The next day, May 13, 2005, Donaubauer's attorney confirmed by letter that Donaubauer was "willing to fulfill his contractual obligations and participate in the appraisal that your client has requested." <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Donaubauer confirmed again via letter on June 1, 2005, that he was "able to participate in the appraisal process" and asked to be contacted regarding the next step.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[252,544,1146,357]]]'>¶ 18. Farmers followed up on June 9, 2005, by-explaining that the appraisal process would commence with Donaubauer's selection of an appraiser. The parties' respective appraisers would then select a third appraiser, the umpire, and proceed with the appraisal process outlined in the Policy. On June 27, 2005, Donaubauer informed Farmers of his selected appraiser.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[250,913,1152,671]]]'>¶ 19. On July 26, 2005, Farmers moved for summary judgment and dismissal of Donaubauer's lawsuit on the grounds that Farmers had no obligation to make payments under the Policy until Donaubauer completed repair or replacement of the dwelling. On September 16, 2005, the Milwaukee County Circuit Court agreed that, under the Policy, Donaubauer had to complete the actual repair or replacement of his home before Farmers was obligated to make further payments. The court dismissed with prejudice Donaubauer's claims and causes of action for misrepresentation, and deferred ruling on Donaubauer's other claims until after the appraisal process had been completed.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[248,1598,1148,252]]]'>¶ 20. On September 29, 2005, Donaubauer sent a letter to Farmers indicating that he would only continue the appraisal process if it was not conducted pursuant to the Policy, and was simply considered part of the mediation process and non-binding.</p>
    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[248,1864,1146,358]],["BL_163.1",163,[181,386,1152,306]]]'>¶ 21. On October 10, 2005, Farmers sent a response in which it stated that it was "not willing to deviate from the appraisal process that our Clients agreed to as is set forth in the insurance policy." On October 21,2005, Donaubauer replied that he was agreeing to continue with the Policy's appraisal process except to the extent that it would be binding. Farmers re<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>sponded again on October 27,2005, that it was unwilling to agree to an appraisal process that was not binding because the Policy provided for binding appraisal, because non-binding appraisal would be a waste of time, and because Donaubauer had already agreed to the appraisal process.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[177,706,1155,1093]]]'>¶ 22. On November 17, 2005, Farmers asked the circuit court to enforce the appraisal agreement between the parties. Donaubauer acknowledged that he had agreed to the appraisal process outlined in the Policy, but he argued that the Policy's appraisal process was not binding, and that Farmers had misled him into thinking it was binding. He further argued that the court should relieve him from the agreement because under <em>Lynch v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=163%20Wis.%202d%201003" class="citation" data-index="0">163 Wis. 2d 1003</a>, 1011-14, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=473%20N.W.2d%20515" class="citation" data-index="1">473 N.W.2d 515</a> (Ct. App. 1991), he asserted, an insured is not required to participate in the appraisal process when the insurance company failed to demand the appraisal prior to the insured's lawsuit. Farmers argued that the appraisal clause, once invoked by either party, was binding on the parties. Farmers also maintained that it would set bad precedent to allow Donaubauer to withdraw from an agreement because he subsequently found case law that might have, if known earlier, led the party to take a different course of action. On January 10, 2006, the circuit court rejected Donaubauer's arguments and granted Farmers' motion to enforce the agreement.</p>

Around this same time, the homebuilder the appraisers had worked with to compute their award submitted a home proposal to Donaubauer. This proposal included interior and exterior layout plans, and a detailed listing of included features such as hardwood floors, a security system, and air conditioning, to name a few. The proposed home was 3,264 square feet, and the contract price was listed at $356,718.75.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> This home proposal was not part of the appraisal award.</p>

Donaubauer was unhappy with the appraisal award, and on December 7, 2006, filed a motion with the circuit court to have the award vacated or modified. Donaubauer argued that the appraisers failed <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>to appreciate their role in the process. He pointed first to the communications between the appraisers, which he had obtained, claiming that they displayed significant confusion by the appraisers and inappropriate judgments regarding the attractiveness or unattractiveness of certain features of his original home. These judgments influenced their award, he maintained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Donaubauer also pointed out that the home proposal from the third-party contractor was more than 600 square feet smaller and came with completely different design features than his old home. He asserted that this also shows the appraisers did not understand their role.

Donaubauer's second argument is that he justifiably relied on Farmers' representations that Donaubauer must participate in the appraisal process once invoked by Farmers. The root of Donaubauer's problem with the agreement is that, after agreeing to the appraisal process, he found a case <em>{Lynch) </em>that he believes would have allowed him to refuse Farmer's demand to participate in the Policy's appraisal process. He asserts that this means Farmers misrepresented the Policy's provisions, that there was a mutual mistake of law, and that the circuit court should have allowed him to withdraw from his agreement to participate in the appraisal process.</p>

Rather, <em>Lynch </em>held that the insurer in that case could not invoke the appraisal clause when it "had ample opportunity" to do so before suit was filed. <em>Lynch, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=163%20Wis.%202d%201003" class="citation" data-index="21">163 Wis. 2d at 1013</a>.

We are confined to determining whether the circuit court erroneously exercised its discretion in enforcing the agreement between the parties. The circuit court had ample reason to bind Donaubauer to his word. Allowing a party to withdraw from an agreement because it did not apprehend the applicable law beforehand sets a dangerous precedent. At the end of the day, "[t]he fact that a[n] [agreement] appears by hindsight to have been a bad bargain is not sufficient by itself to warrant relief." <em>Pasternak v.

The court's role is not to determine whether the third party experts accurately valued the item (as if the court itself could do better job), but whether the third party experts understood and carried out the contractually assigned task.

Appraisals also deserve a more deferential review because the appraisal process is a fair and efficient tool for resolving disputes. First and foremost, the process is fair to both parties. It allows each to appoint an appraiser of their own liking, with a neutral umpire as the deciding vote. Appraisals also promote finality, are time and cost-efficient, and place a difficult factual question — the replacement value of an item — into the hands of those best-equipped to answer that question. As a form of alternative dispute resolution, the appraisal process is favored and encouraged. <em>See generally, State v. P.G. Miron Constr.

If fraud, bad faith, material mistake, or a lack of understanding of the process are reasonably implicated, it is within a judge's discretion to allow further inquiry or discovery.

In the case at bar, Donaubauer challenges the award on the grounds that the appraisers did not understand their role in the process. Here, the face of the award demonstrates that the appraisers understood and accomplished their contractual task. The appraisal award itemized the components of the valuation and gave the replacement cost and actual cash value for each. The award specified values for the dwelling itself, and gave separate additional values for the second floor kitchen, septic system, exterior concrete, exterior blacktop, shed by the garage, outbuildings, trees, sod, flowers, plants, and shrubs.

Since we see nothing on the face of the award that supports a misunderstanding, the communications need not be examined. But even if we took these communications into account, we do not believe they show what Donaubauer alleges.

The appraisers' e-mail communications indicated that they might not understand that they were required to provide an award that would permit Donaubauer to build a new home of "like kind and quality," as provided by the insurance policy. This inference is strengthened by the fact that the very same homebuilder who assisted the appraisers in calculating the amount of the award submitted a proposal for Donaubauer's new home — and it was 600 square feet smaller than the original home. <em>See </em>majority op., ¶ 25.

Rare will be the case, however, where fraud, bad faith, material mistake, or lack of understanding of the process is apparent from the face of an appraisal award. The majority's determination that review is usually limited to the face of the award is thus tantamount to a conclusion that as long as the appraisers provide dollar figures for several enumerated categories, the award will stand. This determination is not adequate to ensure that appraisals are fundamentally fair.</p>

Nevertheless, the award made "no reference to actual cash value; it sets forth only the loss." <em>Id. </em>at 500. The court determined that "The award, on its face, does not comply with the requirements of the policy." Therefore, the court concluded that the appraisal award was "of no effect." <em>Id. </em>at 502.</p>

It is unclear whether the appraisers adhered to the policy's definition of "replacement value" as the cost of replacing Donaubauer's home with a home of "like kind and quality." Unlike in arbitration where an arbitrator must explain his factual conclusions and legal reasoning in a written decision, there is no reasoning that can be tracked on the face of this appraisal award. If Donaubauer is correct and the appraisers did not appreciate their role in the appraisal process to determine the cost of rebuilding a home of like kind and quality, it would likely not be apparent from the face of the appraisal award.</p>
