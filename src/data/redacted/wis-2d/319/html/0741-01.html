    <p id="b845-5" data-blocks='[["BL_845.5",845,[203,1056,1151,719]]]'>¶ 2. On March 28, 2007, school officials at Homestead High School were alerted by an anonymous informant that Schloegel, then a student, was in possession of drugs on school grounds. Approximately three years prior to this incident, Schloegel had been arrested for possessing marijuana on school grounds. School liaison officer, Mandy Rudolph, and Officer Thoenes of the Mequon police department were called to the office to assist in the matter. Assistant principals Matt Joynt and Carrie Wilson called Schloegel to the office. Schloegel consented to searches of his person and book bag. No contraband was found either from his person or book bag. Additionally, a search of Schloegel's locker revealed no contraband.</p>
    <p id="b845-6" data-blocks='[["BL_845.6",845,[205,1791,1155,352]],["BL_846.1",846,[245,386,1150,570]]]'>¶ 3. Assistant principal Wilson asked Schloegel if he would mind if they looked in his car. Schloegel had received a student handbook at the beginning of the school year, which included a parking form containing a consent to search clause. In order for students to park in the school parking lot, students are required to give consent to school administrators to search the vehicle <a id="p746" href="#p746" data-label="746" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*746</a>when they have "reasonable suspicion to believe the search will produce evidence of a violation of a particular law, a school rule, or a condition that endangers the safety or health of the student driver or others." Wilson informed Schloegel that it was school policy to proceed next to a search of his vehicle. Schloegel, Rudolph, and Thoenes accompanied Wilson to the school parking lot where Schloegel's car was parked. Schloegel opened the vehicle at Wilson's request. Wilson searched the car and found a container of marijuana, a pipe, Oxycontin, and cash. She turned the items over to the police.</p>
    <p id="b846-3" data-blocks='[["BL_846.3",846,[240,967,1153,512]]]'>¶ 4. Rudolph asked what the pills were but Schloegel did not answer. She also asked Schloegel whether he had driven his vehicle to school that day, and he answered that he had. She next asked him if he had a prescription for the pills that were found in the car and he stated that he did not. Finally, she asked if the pipe and marijuana were his and no answer was apparent in the record. Rudolph placed Schloegel under arrest and took him to the police station where he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>
    <p id="b846-4" data-blocks='[["BL_846.4",846,[240,1492,1151,355]]]'>¶ 5. Prior to trial, Schloegel moved to suppress all statements he had made to Rudolph, both before and after his arrest. He also moved to suppress the items discovered during the search of his car. The circuit court denied the motions. Schloegel pled no contest on both charges and the court entered judgment accordingly.</p>

Schloegel first presents a multi-layered <em>Miranda </em>issue, arguing (1) that he was in custody at the time of the questioning in the parking lot, (2) that the <a id="p747" href="#p747" data-label="747" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*747</a>questioning was interrogative, and (3) that his preMiranda statements tainted his post-Miranda statements to the point all should be suppressed.</p>
    <p id="b847-5" data-blocks='[["BL_847.5",847,[194,610,1154,989]]]'>¶ 7. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only when a person is in custody. <em>See State v. Morgan, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2002%20WI%20App%20124" class="citation" data-index="0">2002 WI App 124</a>, ¶ 10, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=254%20Wis.%202d%20602" class="citation" data-index="1">254 Wis. 2d 602</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=648%20N.W.2d%2023" class="citation" data-index="2">648 N.W.2d 23</a>. Whether a person is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>is determined by considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Gruen, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=218%20Wis.%202d%20581" class="citation" data-index="3">218 Wis. 2d 581</a>, 594, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=582%20N.W.2d%20728" class="citation" data-index="4">582 N.W.2d 728</a> (Ct. App. 1998). To determine whether a suspect is in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, we ask whether the suspect was formally arrested or "suffered a restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest." <em>State v. Goetz, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2001%20WI%20App%20294" class="citation" data-index="5">2001 WI App 294</a>, ¶ 11, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=249%20Wis.%202d%20380" class="citation" data-index="6">249 Wis. 2d 380</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=638%20N.W.2d%20386" class="citation" data-index="7">638 N.W.2d 386</a>. We employ an objective test, inquiring how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have understood the situation. <em>Morgan, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=254%20Wis.%202d%20602" class="citation" data-index="8">254 Wis. 2d 602</a>, ¶ 10. Furthermore, interrogation that triggers the right to counsel involves direct questioning by police that is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect. <em>See United States v. Briggs, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=273%20F.3d%20737" class="citation" data-index="9">273 F.3d 737</a>, 740 (7th Cir. 2001).</p>
    <p id="b847-7" data-blocks='[["BL_847.7",847,[198,1668,1151,359]]]'>¶ 8. On review, we accept the circuit court's findings of historical fact unless they Eire clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Mosher, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=221%20Wis.%202d%20203" class="citation" data-index="10">221 Wis. 2d 203</a>, 211, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=584%20N.W.2d%20553" class="citation" data-index="11">584 N.W.2d 553</a> (Ct. App. 1998). Whether the facts demonstrate "custody" for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See State v. Armstrong, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=223%20Wis.%202d%20331" class="citation" data-index="12">223 Wis. 2d 331</a>, 352-53, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=588%20N.W.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="13">588 N.W.2d 606</a> (1999).</p>

Schloegel points to several aspects of the <em>pre-Miranda </em>interaction that he argues demonstrate custodiEd interrogation. He emphasizes that two officers — Thoenes and Rudolph — "escorted" him from <a id="p748" href="#p748" data-label="748" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*748</a>the school office to the parking lot. He had been frisked, his book bag searched, and "was forced to surrender his car keys." A reasonable person in his position, Schloegel argues, would have believed he was in custody. In addition, Schloegel asserts, the questions that Rudolph asked him in the parking lot were designed to extract inculpatory statements; specifically, to obtain admissions that Schloegel had no prescription, and therefore no legal explanation, for possessing the Oxycontin, and that the marijuana and pipe were his.</p>
    <p id="b848-4" data-blocks='[["BL_848.4",848,[246,930,1158,1297]],["BL_849.1",849,[201,387,1151,262]]]'>¶ 10. The State agrees with two aspects of Schloegel's argument. First, it concedes that Rudolph's questioning of Schloegel in the parking lot was interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. Second, it acknowledges that Schloegel was not free to leave while Wilson conducted her investigation. Nonetheless, the State disputes that the level of restraint was "of the degree associated with a formal arrest." <em>See Goetz, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=249%20Wis.%202d%20380" class="citation" data-index="14">249 Wis. 2d 380</a>, ¶ 11. Because Schloegel was not in custody, the argument goes, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not yet required. The State emphasizes that Wilson was in control of the investigation up to and including the search of the vehicle. Although Thoenes and Rudolph were present at Wilson's request, Schloegel's summons to the school office and his cooperation in the subsequent search of his car were at Wilson's direction. Rudolph's role was described as "stand by," in case things "got out of control." Thoenes, a male, was present to conduct the frisk of Schloegel in the office because Wilson and Rudolph are female. Further, the State observes, the place and length of Schloegel's detention were not consistent with being placed in custody. Rudolph estimated that no more them fifteen minutes passed between the time she met Schloegel in the school office and the discovery of the drugs in the car. She asked only <a id="p749" href="#p749" data-label="749" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*749</a>a few questions after the drugs were found. The questions were asked in the school parking lot, not in a squad car or police station, which would be more intimidating. Schloegel was not cuffed, and Rudolph was known to Schloegel as the school liaison officer.</p>
    <p id="b849-4" data-blocks='[["BL_849.4",849,[204,673,1150,464]]]'>¶ 11. The State directs us to the circumstances in <em>Gruen, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=218%20Wis.%202d%20581" class="citation" data-index="15">218 Wis. 2d at 598</a>, where we concluded that Gruen was not in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. There, Gruen was detained in a police van for about fifteen minutes, during which he was asked only a few questions. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=218%20Wis.%202d%20581" class="citation" data-index="16">Id.</a> </em>Only two officers were present, and although Gruen was frisked, no guns were drawn. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=218%20Wis.%202d%20581" class="citation" data-index="17">Id.</a> </em>We held that a reasonable person in Gruen's position would not have considered himself to be in custody. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=218%20Wis.%202d%20581" class="citation" data-index="18">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b849-6" data-blocks='[["BL_849.6",849,[206,1222,1150,458]]]'>¶ 12. The analogy is compelling. Here, the degree of restraint was even less than that seen in <em>Gruen. </em>Schloegel was not placed in a police vehicle when questioned and the investigation was being conducted primarily by Wilson. The circuit court phrased it well, stating that Schloegel, "if in custody at all, was in custody of the school and was not being detained by the police at that time." We agree. Without custody, there is no <em>Miranda </em>violation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Next, Schloegel asks whether the minimal expectation of privacy in a school extends to the school parking lot for the purpose of a search conducted by school officials or a school liaison officer. The reasonableness of a search is a constitutional question of law that we review independently, benefiting from the analysis of the lower court. <em>See State v. Angelia D.B., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=211%20Wis.%202d%20140" class="citation" data-index="19">211 Wis. 2d 140</a>, 146, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=564%20N.W.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="20">564 N.W.2d 682</a> (1997). We will uphold the circuit court's findings of evidentiary and historical fact as they relate to whether the search was reasonable, unless they are against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=564%20N.W.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="21">Id.</a></em>

The seminal case setting forth the standard for a search on school grounds by public school officials is <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=469%20U.S.%20325" class="citation" data-index="22">469 U.S. 325</a> (1985). In pronouncing the reasonableness standard for school searches, the United States Supreme Court weighed the contravening interest of student privacy and "the substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and <em>on school grounds." T.L.O., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=469%20U.S.%20325" class="citation" data-index="23">469 U.S. at 339</a> (emphasis added). It instructed that a school search is legal when it satisfies the two-prong test: (1) the search must be "justified at <a id="p751" href="#p751" data-label="751" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*751</a>its inception," and (2) "reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place." <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=469%20U.S.%20325" class="citation" data-index="24">Id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=469%20U.S.%20325" class="citation" data-index="24">at 341-42</a> (citation omitted).</p>
    <p id="b851-4" data-blocks='[["BL_851.4",851,[195,559,1156,1304]]]'>¶ 15. The Wisconsin Supreme Court relied on <em>T.L.O. </em>when it considered the standard of reasonableness for a search of a student on school grounds by a police officer at the request of, and in conjunction with, school authorities; specifically, whether such a search is governed by the reasonable grounds standard set forth in <em>T.L.O. </em>or the general standard of probable cause. <em>Angelia D.B., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=211%20Wis.%202d%20140" class="citation" data-index="25">211 Wis. 2d at 147</a>. We observe many similarities between <em>Angelia D.B. </em>and Schloegel's circumstances. For example, in <em>Angelia D.B., </em>the investigation began with a report from a student to the school principal that another student, Angelia, was engaged in illegal activity. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=211%20Wis.%202d%20140" class="citation" data-index="26">Id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=211%20Wis.%202d%20140" class="citation" data-index="26">at 144</a>.

Although, the supreme court did not define the term "school grounds" in <em>T.L.O., </em>courts have upheld "a school's substantial interest in maintaining discipline on school grounds," and extended the minimal expectation of privacy in the classroom and lockers to the school parking lot. Myron Schreck, <em>The Fourth Amendment in the Public Schools: Issues for the 1990s and Beyond, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=25%20Urb.%20Law.%20117" class="citation" data-index="41">25 Urb.

Because <em>Angelia D.B. </em>teaches that searches on school grounds must be supported by reasonable suspicion, and extensive case law teaches that school parking lots are indeed school grounds for purposes of such an inquiry, we turn to the question of reasonableness. Courts have accepted a variety of scenarios as evidence of reasonableness; for example, a search is reasonable where a student is suspected of violating rules <em>in the school parking lot, </em>the student has received a student handbook regarding vehicle searches <em>parked </em>
      <a id="p754" href="#p754" data-label="754" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*754</a>

    <p id="b854-4" data-blocks='[["BL_854.4",854,[223,913,1153,1325]]]'>¶ 21. In this case, application of the <em>T.L.O. </em>two-prong test to the record facts leads to the conclusion that (1) the search was "justified at its inception," and (2) the search of Schloegel's car was "reasonably related in scope to" the search of contraband. <em>See T.L.O., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=469%20U.S.%20325" class="citation" data-index="48">469 U.S. at 341</a>. The search was justified at its inception because school officials were put on alert that Schloegel was in possession that day of drugs, including pills and possibly some other substances. School officials must act on such a tip. "School officials not only educate students who are compelled to attend school, but they have a responsibility to protect those students and their teachers from behavior that threatens their safety and the integrity of the learning process." <em>Angelia D.B., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=211%20Wis.%202d%20140" class="citation" data-index="49">211 Wis. 2d at 157</a>. Furthermore, Schloegel had a prior drug arrest on record, and Rudolph knew him from that previous arrest. Therefore, the decision to investigate further, and to search for contraband was reasonable at its inception. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>J.D. v. State, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=920%20So.%202d%20117" class="citation" data-index="50">920 So.2d 117</a>, 122 (Fla. Ct.

      <a id="p755" href="#p755" data-label="755" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*755</a>¶ 22. We also conclude that the search was reasonable in scope. Students who decide to bring drugs to school have many places to stash them, and the stated purpose and clear goal of this search was to discover whether Schloegel had contraband at school. A school official has the responsibility to keep students safe on school grounds, and as we have indicated, this includes school parking lots. When searches of Schloegel's person, backpack and locker were cleared, it was a reasonable next step for school officials to take the search to Schloegel's car.</p>

Because the facts in this case meet the <em>T.L.O. </em>test, the search of Schloegel's car parked in the school parking lot was legal.
