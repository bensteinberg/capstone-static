The person requesting the <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>transcript, Heidi Morgan (Morgan), filed notice to intervene, as <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2019.356" class="citation" data-index="2">Wis. Stat. § 19.356</a>(4) authorizes, and appealed. The court of appeals denied Zellner's motion to dismiss on grounds that the appeal was not timely filed and subsequently certified two questions to this court: whether a transcript of a closed arbitration proceeding is a public record under Wisconsin's "public records" law, and, if so, whether all personal and medical information must be redacted before release. Zellner's contention that Morgan's appeal was untimely was not certified to this court. In this court's standard order accepting the certification, we stated that "the appeal is accepted for consideration of all issues raised before the court of appeals." <em>See State v.

The time period specified in that statute is 20 days. Because the appeal was filed outside the 20-day period, there was no jurisdiction for the court of appeals to review. Since the appeal was not timely, we do not reach the certified questions.</p>

    <p id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.3",635,[199,384,1152,569]]]'>
      <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>¶ 6. First, the Cedarburg School Board fired Zellner — a teacher with the Cedarburg School District (the District) and a union official who had been highly critical of the superintendent — on the grounds that Zellner's accessing pornography on a school computer constituted just cause for his termination. The Cedar-burg Education Association filed a grievance on Zellner's behalf, arguing that Zellner's termination was, among other things, disproportionate to the offense and greatly out of line with the District's handling of similar infractions by other personnel.</p>
    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[199,969,1149,413]]]'>¶ 7. The matter was sent to an arbitration panel, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. The arbitration panel issued a decision stating that the District "did not have just cause to terminate [Zellner's] employment," and directing the District to reinstate Zellner, reduce his discipline to a written reprimand, and to make him whole for all lost wages and benefits. The District refused and additional litigation ensued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[198,1398,1151,244]]]'>¶ 8. Following the arbitration hearing, Morgan requested the transcript of the closed arbitration hearing. The District concluded that the transcript was a public record and informed Zellner that it planned to release it.</p>

On October 1, 2007, the Ozaukee Circuit Court, the Honorable Paul V Malloy presiding, entered an order enjoining the District from releasing the transcript. The circuit court held that the transcript was a public record, but it then applied the second prong of the <em>Linzmeyer </em>test<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and held that the transcript was not subject to release because the public's interest in the release of the transcript was outweighed by the public policy favoring privacy in an alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Stat. § 19.356</a>(4) and on the same day filed a notice of appeal. On November 16, 2007, Zellner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Zellner argued that Morgan had filed her notice of appeal more than 20 days after the circuit court's October 1 order, and, therefore, the appeal was not timely filed pursuant to <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20808.04" class="citation" data-index="8">Wis.

In an order dated December 5, 2007, the court of appeals denied Zellner's motion to dismiss.

The circuit court went on to rule that the transcript should not be released on the grounds that "the public interest is outweighed by the need for privacy in this type of proceeding." The court stated that it would issue an order enjoining the District from releasing the materials. The order was issued October 1, 2007.</p>

    <p id="b639-6" data-blocks='[["BL_639.6",639,[188,1131,1157,464]]]'>¶ 19. The significance of the dispute about the applicable time period — either 20 or 45 days following the issuance of the circuit court's order — is that Morgan filed her notice of appeal 39 days after the order.

Judicial deference to the policy choices enacted into law by the legislature requires that statutory interpretation focus primarily on the language of the statute. We assume that the legislature's intent is expressed in the statutory language. Extrinsic evidence <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>of legislative intent may become relevant to statutory interpretation in some circumstances, but is not the primary focus of inquiry. It is the enacted law, not the unenacted intent, that is binding on the public. Therefore, the purpose of statutory interpretation is to determine what the statute means so that it may be given its full, proper, and intended effect.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b640-3" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[327,766,1000,329]]]'>Thus, we have repeatedly held that statutory interpretation "begins with the language of the statute. If the meaning of the statute is plain, we ordinarily stop the inquiry."

    <blockquote id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.5",640,[326,1141,1004,571]]]'>Context is important to meaning. So, too, is the structure of the statute in which the operative language appears. Therefore, statutory language is interpreted in the context in which it is used; not in isolation but as part of a whole; in relation to the language of surrounding or closely-related statutes; and reasonably, to avoid absurd or unreasonable results. Statutory language is read where possible to give reasonable effect to every word, in order to avoid surplusage. "If this process of analysis yields a plain, clear statutory meaning, then there is no ambiguity, and the statute is applied according to this ascertainment of its meaning."</blockquote>

Our reading is entirely consistent with the legislature's demonstrated interest in resolving these disputes as speedily as possible.

The essence of the <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>statute is to prescribe the special handling of matters involving an attempt to block release of a record under the Open Records Law and to require that they be expedited to resolution.

To that end, ss. <em>19.32 to 19.37 shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of complete public access, </em>consistent with the conduct of governmental business.

The Public Records Law contains two procedural pathways of review, depending on whether the custodian of the records decides to deny, or to provide, access to the requested records. If the custodian denies access, a requester of the records has 90 days in which to commence a mandamus action in circuit court. <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2019.37" class="citation" data-index="83">Wis.

Stat. § 19.31</a>'s stated purpose. This is so because more time is given to a requester, who is acting in accord with the policy of providing complete access to public records. Less time is given to a record subject, who is attempting to block access to public records, an action contrary to the stated purpose of the Public Records Law. § 19.31.</p>

If the circuit court in a requester's mandamus action affirms the custodian's decision not to release the records, then a requester has 45 days after notice of entry of judgment, or 90 days if no notice is given, to appeal the circuit court decision to the court of appeals. <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20808.04" class="citation" data-index="86">Wis.

However, if the circuit court, in a record subject's action commenced to enjoin release of the public records, denies the injunction, a record subject has only 20 days in which to file an appeal. § 808.04(lm). Again, this difference in the time accorded to seek further review is consistent with the statutory purpose of affording access to the records of government affairs: a requester, whose actions are in line with access, is given more time, and a record subject, who is trying to thwart access, is given less time to appeal an adverse decision. <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2019.31" class="citation" data-index="87">Wis.
