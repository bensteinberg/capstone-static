The petitioner, Ruben Baez Godoy, seeks review of a published court of appeals decision affirming the circuit court's order dismissing his defective design claims in strict liability and negligence against manufacturers of white lead carbonate pigment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The issue presented here is whether the circuit court correctly concluded that Godoy's complaint failed to state a claim of defective design where (1) the product is white lead carbonate pigment; (2) the alleged design defect is the presence of lead; and (3) the defendant manufacturers were manufacturers of white lead carbonate pigment.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.8",200,[246,1236,1156,568]]]'>¶ 2. We determine that the circuit court correctly concluded that the complaint failed to state claims of defective design. A claim for defective design cannot be maintained here where the presence of lead is the alleged defect in design, and its very presence is a characteristic of the product itself. Without lead, there can be no white lead carbonate pigment. We therefore conclude that the complaint fails to allege a design feature that makes the design of white lead carbonate pigment defective. Accordingly, albeit with some clarification of the rationale, we affirm the court of appeals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[182,782,1152,315]]]'>¶ 4. Ruben Baez Godoy is a minor child who grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When he was approximately one year old, he lived in an apartment at 1502 West Windlake Avenue. The surfaces of the apartment had been coated with paint containing white lead carbonate pigment.</p>
    <p id="b201-6" data-blocks='[["BL_201.6",201,[185,1120,1150,308]]]'>¶ 5. Beginning in March of 1998 and for the duration of his tenancy, Godoy sustained lead poisoning. The source of the lead poisoning was white lead carbonate pigment derived from painted surfaces, paint chips, paint flakes, and dust containing paint in his apartment.</p>
    <p id="b201-7" data-blocks='[["BL_201.7",201,[185,1450,1151,519]],["BL_202.1",202,[245,388,1147,101]]]'>¶ 6. The defendants in this case include E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Armstrong Containers, the Sherwin-Williams Company, and American Cyanamid (collectively, "manufacturer defendants"). These defendants designed, manufactured, processed, marketed, promoted, supplied, distributed and/or sold white lead carbonate products used as a pigment in paints and coatings for residential use. Godoy alleged that the intended purpose of white lead carbonate pigment was as an ingredient in paint. Godoy is unable <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>to identify the particular manufacturer of the white lead carbonate pigment present in the apartment.</p>
    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[242,514,1151,695]]]'>¶ 7. Ingesting white lead carbonate pigment, like other products containing lead, can cause severe and permanent injuries including learning disabilities, decreased intelligence, deficits in neurophsychological functioning, coma, seizure, and death. By the second half of the twentieth century, manufacturers and members of the scientific community acknowledged that lead is hazardous to human health and that children could get lead poisoning through exposure to paint containing lead. Godoy alleges that the manufacturer defendants nonetheless promoted the use of white lead carbonate pigment in residential paints, marketing it as a safe product that fostered health and well-being.</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[241,1234,1149,478]]]'>¶ 8. Godoy filed suit alleging, among other things, that white lead carbonate pigment is defectively designed and that the defendant manufacturers are liable under theories of strict liability and negligence. Although three of the manufacturer defendants designed and manufactured paint in addition to white lead carbonate pigment, Godoy filed suit against them in the capacity of white lead carbonate pigment manufacturers, not in the capacity of paint manufacturers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The manufacturer defendants responded by filing a motion to dismiss the defective design claims. They argued that Godoy did not identify a legally cognizable design defect in white lead carbonate pigment and that, as a result, his complaint failed to state design defect claims upon which relief could be <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>granted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The circuit court dismissed the design defect claims, concluding that "lead is an inherent characteristic of white lead carbonate," and that white lead carbonate pigment cannot be designed without lead.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[176,619,1151,458]]]'>¶ 10. Godoy was granted permission to file an interlocutory appeal. The court of appeals affirmed the order of the circuit court, determining that a product cannot be said to be defectively designed when that design is inherent in the nature of the product so that an alternative design would make the product something else. <em>See Godoy ex rel. v.

In its analysis, the court noted that Wisconsin has neither accepted nor rejected the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability. <em>Id., </em>¶ 8. Nonetheless, the opinion stated that the Restatement (Third) could "illumine" its inquiry. <em>Id. </em>The court quoted the definition of design defect from the Restatement (Third), and then applied the facts to that definition. <em>Id. </em>Unlike Wisconsin law, the Restatement (Third) requires proof of a reasonable alternative design in design defect cases. <em>Id. </em>Noting that "there is no 'alternative design' to make white-lead carbonate without using lead," the court concluded that the Restatement (Third) "does not sanction imposing liability on the defendants." <em>Id.</em>

Shortly thereafter, the American Law Institute introduced the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which included for the first time "Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer." <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A (1965). This section created a new rule of strict liability, holding sellers of defective products liable for defective products even if "the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of [the] product." <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=377%20P.2d%20897" class="citation" data-index="17">Id.</a> </em>§ 402A(2)(a); <em>see also <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=377%20P.2d%20897" class="citation" data-index="18">id.</a> </em>cmt. a.

In response, the American Law Institute introduced the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability in 1998. One major innovation was that the Restatement (Third) split products liability into three distinct categories: manufacturing defects, design defects, and defects based on failure to warn. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 2 (1998). In defining these categories, the restatement eschewed the doctrinal labels "strict liability" and "negligence."

To illustrate, the lead opinion reasons that a claim for defective design cannot be maintained against the manufacturers of white lead carbonate pigment "where the presence of lead is the alleged defect in design, and its very presence is a characteristic of the product itself."

Specifically, the opinion states, "Without lead, there can be no white lead carbonate pigment." <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20N.W.2d%20727" class="citation" data-index="227">Id.</a> </em>Similarly, Restatement (Third) § 2(b) would not impose liability against the pigment manufacturers for defective design because it would be impossible for them to design white lead carbonate pigment without using lead, <em>see <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=629%20N.W.2d%20727" class="citation" data-index="228">id.,</a> </em>and therefore, the plaintiff would be unable to submit evidence of a reasonable alternative design that, if adopted, would reduce or eliminate white lead carbonate pigment's potential dangers, <em>see </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability § 2. Although claiming not to "require that a plaintiff affirmatively prove ... that an alternative design is commercially viable," <em>see </em>lead op., ¶ 45, the rationale employed by the lead opinion is ultimately tantamount to a conclusion that the plaintiffs claim must fail because he cannot establish a reasonable alternative design for white lead carbonate pigment.</p>
