This is a review of a published court of appeals decision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that reversed a grant of summary judgment for the petitioner and remanded the case to the circuit court. This wrongful death case concerns a claim by cross-respondents (the Umanskys) that Barry Fox (Fox), the director of facilities for Camp Randall Stadium, negligently caused the death of Richard Umansky (Umansky) by failing to enforce a specific safety regulation at Camp Randall. Umansky was a television cameraman for ABC, Inc. He fell approximately eight feet to his death from a four-foot by eight-foot platform supplied by the University. There was no railing on Umansky's platform at the time. The Wisconsin legislature has adopted federal safety regulations and made them applicable for all public buildings, and such regulations require that railings be installed on platforms like the one from which Umansky fell.</p>

As a state employee, however, Fox enjoys immunity from liability unless, under the circumstances, at least one of the limited exceptions to immunity applies. We must address whether Fox's obligation pursuant to statute to act to ensure that Camp Randall Stadium complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation requiring a <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>railing on certain types of platforms creates a ministerial duty exception to the standard rule of state employee immunity. Specifically, the narrow question we address is whether Fox had a ministerial duty under <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.23" class="citation" data-index="0">29 C.F.R. § 1910.23</a>(c)(1), incorporated by Wis.

Finding that no exception applied, the Dane County Circuit Court, the Honorable John C. Albert presiding, granted summary judgment for Fox. The Umanskys appealed. The court of appeals reversed, making a number of rulings favorable to the Umanskys related to the issue of whether Fox had a ministerial duty and is thus unable to claim immunity.</p>

However, the court of appeals declined to address one of Fox's arguments, newly made on appeal, deeming it waived. Because of the potential impact of the new argument<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> on a determination of whether Fox's employer was required by state law to comply with the applicable regulation, the court of appeals stopped short of holding that the regulation applied to Fox's employer, leaving that determination to be made on <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>remand to the circuit court.

Further, because we reach and ultimately reject the argument that the regulation at issue does not apply to Fox's employer, our holding resolves the remaining question from the court of appeals' rulings. We thus remand to the circuit court, having answered the threshold question concerning Fox's immunity from suit by concluding that Fox had a ministerial duty to perform the act of ensuring that the platform complied with the applicable regulation. The focus of the circuit court must be on breach, causation, comparison of fault, and damages, not on the question of by whom the deceased was employed. We remand for a trial on the Umanskys' negligence claim.</p>

Because Umansky was not a public employee, Fox argues, the duty does not run to him. The basis for this argument is that the relevant administrative code provision notes that its purpose is to create work safety standards for public employees,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and the underlying statute has the stated purpose of giving public employees workplace safety protections equivalent to those afforded to private employees under OSHA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> We therefore turn our attention from the specific regulation that creates a ministerial duty here to the statute and administrative code sections that authorized it. The stated purpose of the <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>statute is to offer <em>equivalent </em>occupational safety protections. That purpose is turned on its head by Fox's reading that argues for a divided, haphazardly applicable ministerial duty to comply with the explicit OSHA regulation requiring a railing on a platform. That such an approach is unworkable is readily apparent given the nature of the ministerial duty created by this regulation. The regulation, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.23" class="citation" data-index="46">29 C.F.R. § 1910.23</a>(c)(1), incorporated by Wis. Admin. §§ Comm 32.15 and 32.50, created a ministerial duty to comply with the safety regulation requiring railings on platforms such as the one involved here. Fox urges the peculiar conclusion that even though the administrative code adopted pursuant to <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.055" class="citation" data-index="47">Wis.

It was Fox's responsibility, as director of facilities for Camp Randall Stadium, to be sure that the Stadium complied with OSHA regulations. Period.

As we noted earlier in this opinion, the court of appeals deemed a new argument Fox raised at oral argument before it waived and declined to address it though the court left open the possibility that the argument could be pursued on remand to the circuit court. Before this court, Fox made a similar argument. The argument overlaps considerably with the argument just discussed; Fox contends that the question is not whether the platform was generally required to have a railing, but whether the platform was required to have a railing at the time Umansky fell. Fox submits that because there has been no evidence submitted that a public employee was using the platform at the time Umansky fell,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> the Umanskys have failed to allege <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>facts that would establish a ministerial duty and that summary judgment should therefore be granted in his favor. This is a variation on his earlier argument. The first, addressed above, turns on the identity of the person injured (i.e., if two persons were on the platform and both fell, no ministerial duty exception could apply as to the private employee, and a claim by that person's representative would be barred by immunity). This argument focuses on the platform itself, and the use of the platform by a public employee at the relevant time (i.e., only if it were alleged that a public employee was occupying the platform at the moment the private employee fell, the ministerial duty exception would apparently apply, and a claim by the private employee's representative would not be barred by immunity).</p>

Since the issue was raised again here, we exercise our discretion to reach it, rather than deem it waived.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> Fox's argument to this court was that the material facts — that no public employee was on the platform at the time Umansky fell and that Umansky himself was not a public employee — were undisputed. Because Fox argues that at least one of those conditions would have to be met in order to establish a ministerial duty, he contends that absent such evidence, summary judgment in his favor is appropriate.</p>

First, both <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.055" class="citation" data-index="189">Wis. Stat. § 101.055</a> and Wis. Admin. Code § Comm 32.001 plainly state that the standards adopted pursuant to these provisions are meant to protect the safety and health of public employees. "Public employee or employee" "means any employee of the state, or any state agency or of any political subdivision of the state." Wis. Admin. Code § Comm 32.01(5). Thus, to the extent that a ministerial duty may arise out of these provisions, that ministerial duty is owed to public employees. Umansky, however, was a private employee of ABC, Inc. Because the relevant provisions address only a duty to public employees, any action Fox could have taken that would <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>have benefitted Umansky was discretionary rather than ministerial.</p>
    <p id="b775-4" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[203,506,1157,1356]]]'>¶ 102. Second, the legislature's decision to reference public employees only and thus limit the provision's applicability must be respected because the provisions could have been drafted more broadly. <em>See C. Coakley Relocation Sys., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2008%20WI%2068" class="citation" data-index="190">2008 WI 68</a>, ¶ 24 n.10, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=310%20Wis.%202d%20456" class="citation" data-index="191">310 Wis. 2d 456</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=750%20N.W.2d%20900" class="citation" data-index="192">750 N.W.2d 900</a> (stating that courts must presume that the legislature says what it means in a statute; the legislature's omissions must be respected; and it is generally not acceptable for courts to insert words into the statute). If the legislature meant for this statute to apply to more than just public employees, it could have included other verbiage, such as the word "frequenters." For example, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.11" class="citation" data-index="193">Wis. Stat. § 101.11</a>(1), Employer's duty to furnish safe employment and place, provides that "[e]very employer shall furnish employment which shall be safe for the employees therein and shall furnish a place of employment which <em>shall be safe for employees therein and for frequenters </em>thereof and shall furnish and use safety devices and safeguards . . . (Emphasis added.) In contrast, the legislature used no such language to expand coverage beyond public employees in the provisions now at issue. The majority opinion today, however, makes the state a deep pocket for any frequenter of a state building despite the fact that the term "frequenter" is absent from the relevant statutes and codes.</p>

Third, unlike in <em>Lister, Kimps, Lodl, </em>and <em>Noffke </em>where the controlling documents contained no restrictions as to whom a ministerial duty could be owed, the statute and code in this case do contain a restriction as to whom a ministerial duty may be owed — a public employee. We must respect the legislature's decision. When the legislature enacted <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>protective provisions, it limited that protection to public employees. This, however, does not provide a public employee with more protection than a private employee because <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.2" class="citation" data-index="194">29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.2</a> and 1910.23 on their face protect private employees.

    <p id="b776-4" data-blocks='[["BL_776.4",776,[238,821,1155,619]]]'>¶ 104. Fourth, the foregoing interpretation is consistent with the principle that an administrative rule may not be read so as to provide protection broader than that contemplated by its authorizing statute. <em>Josam Mfg.

Stat. § 101.055</a>, clearly sets forth that the protections belong specifically to public employees. If we conclude that the provisions at issue here could establish that Fox had a ministerial duty to Umansky, we would be reading the provisions well beyond the stated purpose of protecting public employees.</p>
    <p id="b776-5" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[234,1457,1153,775]],["BL_777.1",777,[207,401,1149,203]]]'>¶ 105.

If no public employees ever worked on the platform in question, then it was not a regulated "platform" under § 1910.21(a)(4) from the perspective of the state administrative code, and therefore Fox was under no obligation to maintain a railing. Were that found to be the case, the only employer who would have had an obligation to maintain a railing would be ABC, Inc., <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>Umansky's actual employer — the only employer from whose perspective this platform was in fact a "platform" under OSHA.</p>

At the very least, this court should follow the court of appeals' lead and leave this question open for further fact-finding on remand before concluding as a matter of law that Fox was required to maintain a railing on the platform in question.

The majority cannot seriously intend to suggest that the burden of maintaining a railing around <em>every single </em>architectural structure which might be used by third parties as a platform at Camp Randall Stadium should be placed on Fox. Certainly, there must be a limit on the scope of his duties, even under the majority's view. That limit is apparent from the language of Wis. Admin. Code § Comm 32.001, which requires state employers to conform to "minimum occupational safety and health standards for <em>public employees" </em>(emphasis added). Private employers are responsible for their employees' safety under OSHA. Contrary to the majority's conclusions, Fox should not be expected to be everybody's keeper.</p>

The Umanskys and the majority argue that the ministerial nature of Fox's duty cannot depend on the status of the person who is injured by Fox's negligence. The Umanskys assert that such a distinction is contrary to the text of the .relevant provisions. Injury at a public place of employment, the Umanskys argue, is the determining factor in this case and, thus, the <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>distinction between public and private employees is irrelevant under their theory.

Second, such an interpretation does not, as the Umanskys argue, lead to more protection for public employees than for private employees. Both private and public employees are equally protected when working on the platform at issue in this case. On their face, the OSHA regulations apply to protect a private employee. <em>See </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201910.1" class="citation" data-index="209">29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1</a>, 1910.2, 1910.5.

Third, it is not that the ABC employee is without recourse, but rather, the proper recourse is not against Fox individually. A private employee has recourse against his employer. Under the Umanskys' logic, Umansky, unlike a state employee, is entitled to a windfall. Unlike a state employee, the ABC employee can obtain one recovery against his employer and one recovery against a public employee. However, a public employee would be limited to just one recovery. <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20102.04" class="citation" data-index="211">Wis.

It is also telling that the Umanskys have gone out of their way to avoid having the claim characterized as being brought under Wisconsin's Safe Place Statute, despite the fact that many of their allegations, at first glance, would seem to state the type of claim that should be brought under that statute. <em>See </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.11" class="citation" data-index="220">Wis.

Stated <a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>otherwise, the majority uses OSHA regulations to create a cause of action where no cause of action would otherwise exist. Furthermore, this cause of action will now be even easier to prove than ordinary negligence.</p>
    <p id="b786-4" data-blocks='[["BL_786.4",786,[236,615,1156,933]]]'>¶ 125. The effect of the majority's analysis is not just to disregard <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20653" class="citation" data-index="250">29 U.S.C.A. § 653</a>(b)(4), however. By giving the Umanskys a cause of action on these facts and based on the allegations they have set forth, the majority is permitting the Umanskys to pursue what is essentially an action under the safe place statute, while allowing them to avoid the inconvenient case law stating that (1) the duty imposed by the safe place statute is discretionary, not ministerial, and therefore cannot create an exception to public officer immunity, <em>Spencer, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=215%20Wis.%202d%20641" class="citation" data-index="251">215 Wis. 2d at 651</a>; and (2) only an employer or owner can be sued for a violation of the safe place statute, <em>Pitrowski, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=55%20Wis.%202d%20615" class="citation" data-index="252">55 Wis. 2d at 624</a>; <em>Wasley, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=50%20Wis.%202d%20738" class="citation" data-index="253">50 Wis. 2d at 744</a>. The majority has allowed the Umanskys' creative lawyering to result in the manufacture of a new cause of action heretofore unheard of under Wisconsin law. It has abandoned all protections of the public fisc that governmental immunity is intended to provide.</p>

    <p id="b786-6" data-blocks='[["BL_786.6",786,[233,1713,1151,516]],["BL_787.1",787,[179,389,1151,146]]]'>¶ 126. This case requires a straightforward analysis of the Wisconsin statutes and administrative code in order to determine whether Fox was immune from liability arising out of an incident that occurred at Camp Randall Stadium. The majority disposes of this case by ignoring the plain language of the Wisconsin statutes and administrative code and instead improperly relies on OSHA provisions to create a ministerial duty where none exists. Because Fox had no ministerial duty in this case, there is no exception to the rule of <a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>immunity. As a result, I would conclude that Fox is immune from liability, and therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>
