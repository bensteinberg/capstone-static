This is a review of a published decision of the court of appeals affirming the judgment of the Washington County Circuit Court, Annette K. Ziegler, Judge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After a jury trial, the circuit court rejected plaintiffs' negligence and strict products liability personal injury claims. Plaintiffs moved for a new trial, challenging the accuracy of the jury instructions on the strict products liability claim. The circuit court concluded that the jury was properly instructed and denied the motion for a new trial. The court of appeals affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b250-7" data-blocks='[["BL_250.10",250,[279,1650,1154,463]],["BL_251.1",251,[177,390,1150,402]]]'>¶ 2. The jury instructions were based on Wisconsin Jury Instruction — Civil 3260 with a supplemental statement regarding bystander claims. The jury was informed that a bystander personal injury claim in strict products liability is only available if the product is unreasonably dangerous based on the expectations of an ordinary user or consumer (the "consumer contemplation test"). Plaintiffs claim that this jury instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. They contend <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>that when a product is dangerous only to a bystander and not to a user or consumer, the consumer contemplation test is inappropriate. Rather, the jury should be instructed that a product is unreasonably dangerous based on the contemplation and expectations of an ordinary bystander. They call this a "bystander contemplation test," and assert that this is and should be the law in Wisconsin.</p>
    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[177,813,1150,307]]]'>¶ 3. Thus, the main question before us is whether Wisconsin has adopted or should adopt a "bystander contemplation test." If the bystander contemplation test is the law, we must determine whether the circuit court's jury instructions were a misstatement of the law, and if so, whether the error was prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[172,1132,1156,516]]]'>¶ 4. We hold that the consumer contemplation test, and not a bystander contemplation test, governs all strict products liability claims in Wisconsin, including cases where a bystander is injured. While bystanders may recover when injured by an unreasonably dangerous product, the determination of whether the product is unreasonably dangerous is based on the expectations of the ordinary consumer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Therefore, the jury was properly instructed, and the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>

On the afternoon of May 2, 2004, the Horst family returned <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>home from an overnight trip to Wisconsin Dells. Two-year-old Jonathan and his older brother went to play outside in the yard. Jonathan's mother, Kara, was planning to watch Jonathan as she hung laundry on an outdoor clothesline, but stopped to use the restroom first. Before Kara arrived outside, Jonathan's father Michael decided to mow the lawn using their John Deere LT160 riding lawn mower. As Michael began to cut the lawn, he decided to mow in reverse along the rear of the house, looking over his right shoulder. Jonathan, however, had moved behind the lawn mower to Michael's left, out of Michael's line of sight. As Michael proceeded backwards, he saw Jonathan's shoe come out the other side. Michael screamed, realizing that he had severed both of Jonathan's feet. Kara called 911, and Jonathan was flown to Children's Hospital. There he received multiple surgeries, and now wears prosthetics on both legs.</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[260,1344,1150,460]]]'>¶ 6. The John Deere LT160 mower Michael was using came equipped with a no-mow-in-reverse safety feature that stops both the engine and mower blades when an operator begins to travel in reverse while the mower blades are engaged. However, the lawn mower also had what amounts to an override feature, the Reverse Implement Option ("RIO"), which allows an operator to mow in reverse with the mower blades in operation.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[258,1823,1150,409]],["BL_253.1",253,[161,405,1148,98]]]'>¶ 7. To implement the RIO feature, an operator must depress the brake pedal and press the RIO switch. Once engaged, the RIO system allows an operator to mow in reverse without stalling either the engine or the mowing device. When reverse mowing is complete, the operator can continue to mow forward without shutting off the mowing device. When the operator begins mowing forward again, the lawn mower returns to its <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>default position, which requires the operator to manually engage the RIO device again to mow in reverse.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[160,515,1150,359]]]'>¶ 8. Michael Horst engaged the RIO device twice before the accident in this case. He first engaged the RIO to mow toward the Horst home along his gravel driveway. He then moved forward along the back of the house. He engaged the RIO device again to mow in reverse along the back of the house. That is when Jonathan was injured.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[160,886,1150,204]]]'>¶ 9. The LT160 lawn mower operator's manual contained numerous warnings relating to mowing in reverse and mowing in the presence of children or bystanders. The warnings included the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[237,1134,996,133]]]'>• Before backing up, stop mower blades or attachments and look down and behind the machine carefully, especially for children.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b253-7" data-blocks='[["BL_253.7",253,[237,1311,998,172]]]'>• CAUTION: Avoid injury! Children or bystanders may be injured by runover [sic] and rotating blades. Before backing up, carefully check the area around the machine.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b253-8" data-blocks='[["BL_253.8",253,[236,1535,997,86]]]'>• NOTE: Backing up while the mower is engaged is strongly discouraged.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b253-9" data-blocks='[["BL_253.9",253,[236,1667,999,181]]]'>• The Reverse Implement Option should be used only when operating another implement (attachment) or when the operator deems it necessary to reposition the machine with the mower engaged.</blockquote>
    <p id="b253-10" data-blocks='[["BL_253.10",253,[159,1891,1150,147]]]'>The parties agree that Michael read but disregarded these warnings, choosing to mow in reverse in the presence of his young children.</p>
    <p id="b253-11" data-blocks='[["BL_253.11",253,[159,2049,1151,204]],["BL_254.1",254,[276,400,1150,479]]]'>¶ 10. Following the accident, the Horsts filed a lawsuit against Deere &amp; Company ("Deere") in Washington County Circuit Court, bringing negligence and strict products liability claims. On the strict products <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>liability claim, the Horsts argued that designing a mower to operate in reverse is unreasonably dangerous and that the mower should have had an alternative design. The Horsts asserted that the lawn mower should not have been equipped with the RIO, thus preventing an operator from ever mowing in reverse. The Horsts also sought punitive damages, alleging that the design demonstrated a deliberate disregard for safety.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[271,904,1153,588]]]'>¶ 11. Deere moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the "consumer contemplation test" barred Jonathan's strict products liability claim. The circuit court denied the motion for summary judgment. It concluded that while bystanders injured by unreasonably dangerous products may recover under <em>Howes v. Hansen, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=56%20Wis.%202d%20247" class="citation" data-index="0">56 Wis. 2d 247</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=201%20N.W.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="1">201 N.W.2d 825</a> (1972) (hereafter <em>"Howes I"), </em>the question of whether the product was unreasonably dangerous and whether punitive damages should be awarded were issues of fact for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[274,1515,1149,715]]]'>¶ 12. At trial, the Horsts requested that Wisconsin Jury Instruction — Civil 3260, which does not mention bystanders, be supplemented to reflect the availability of recovery for bystanders. They specifically proposed that the instruction include the phrase "or bystander" following most occurrences of "user" and "consumer" in the standard instruction. The circuit court denied the Horsts' proposed instructions, choosing to give the standard instructions supplemented with the following statement: "The law in Wisconsin imposes a duty on a manufacturer to a bystander, if the bystander is injured by a defective product, which is unreasonably dangerous to the ordinary user or consumer."</p>
    <p id="b255-3" data-blocks='[["BL_255.3",255,[175,389,1150,413]]]'>
      <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>¶ 13. The Horsts also requested a special verdict question asking the jury: "Do you find from the evidence that the subject lawn tractor, when it left the hands of Defendant, Deere &amp; Company, was in a defective condition so as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective user/consumer or bystander?" The circuit court denied this request and submitted the question to the jury without the "or bystander" language.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b256-3" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[261,390,1150,362]]]'>
      <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>¶ 14. The jury ultimately found both Michael and Kara Horst, but not Deere, negligent in the injury to their son, Jonathan. The jury also found that the lawn mower in question was not in a defective condition so as to be unreasonably dangerous to a prospective user or consumer. Accordingly, Deere was not strictly liable for Jonathan's injuries.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.7",256,[262,775,1149,357]]]'>¶ 15. After the jury verdict, the Horsts moved for a new trial on the grounds that the jury was improperly instructed. The circuit court concluded that the instruction was in accord with the facts and existing case law, and thus was not prejudicial. The circuit court therefore denied the motion for a new trial and dismissed the Horsts' claims with prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.8",256,[261,1156,1154,349]],["BL_257.1",257,[167,390,1149,147]]]'>¶ 16. The Horsts filed a notice of appeal with the court of appeals, and also filed a petition to bypass with this court, which was denied. On its review, the court of appeals agreed with the circuit court, concluding that the consumer contemplation test is the proper test for unreasonably dangerous products, and that the jury instructions constituted an accurate statement of the <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>law. <em>Horst v.

In the early 1960s, during this same time, the American Law Institute was drafting what became the Restatement (Second) of Torts. The Restatement (Second) attempted to capture this emerging line of cases by creating a new category of tort claims — strict products liability — which it set forth in the newly created § 402A. Although strict products liability was still in its intellectual infancy, § 402A was remarkably influential in speeding the adoption of this emerging area of law in courts around the country. <em>See </em>Douglas A.

This liability system, then, spreads the cost of the injury risk to all consumers. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=155%20N.W.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="18">Id.</a> </em>The justification relied upon by courts is that companies have the capacity to bear the costs and the ability to assume them more efficiently than individuals.</p>

Finally, a third reason for strict products liability is that it provides a strong incentive for deterrence. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability (hereafter "Restatement (Third)") § 2 cmt. a (1998). When a manufacturer can reasonably prevent an injury, strict products liability gives them a strong incentive to do so. This litigation threat promotes manufacturer investment in safer designs, quality control, and the furnishing of adequate warnings to the purchasers and users of products. <em>Id.; </em>§ 402A cmt. j.</p>

Consumers are also not protected if they proceed in the face of a known, though not open and obvious, danger. <em>See </em>§ 402A cmt. n ("If the user or consumer discovers the defect and is aware of the danger, and nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the product and is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.").

However the <em>Vincer </em>case is construed, it is clear that it strongly supports the notion that even when the injured person is not an ordinary user or consumer (which the child surely is not), the consumer contemplation test, which looks at the expectations of the ordinary adult user or consumer, is the framework under which a product's defectiveness is to be governed.

While an ordinary consumer or user of a product can be said to have some objective expectations regarding a product, the same cannot be said of bystanders. The consumer contemplation test was developed in recognition of the fact that it is reasonable for users and consumers of products to hold certain expectations regarding the products they use and the products they buy. <em>See </em>Rebecca Korzec, <em>Dashing Consumer Hopes: Strict Products Liability and the Demise of the Consumer Expectations Test, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=20%20B.C.%20Int%27l%20%26%20Comp.%20L.%20Rev.%20227" class="citation" data-index="71">20 B.C.

L. Rev. 227</a>, 232 (1997) ("[T]he consumer expectations test is the natural, logical outgrowth of strict products liability as the extension of implied warranty law."). Thus, the concept of an "ordinary consumer" has some reasonably objective content. But bystanders may have no familiarity with a product. This is especially so in complex design defect cases. What does a bystander expect of the technical design and reasonably available safety features of a product he or she does not buy, does not use, and may not even be aware of?</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[161,975,1155,359]]]'>¶ 70. In addition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to discern who an "ordinary" bystander is and what they know.

One of the basic requirements of a coherent legal test is that it offer a framework for analyzing claims that provides some measure of predictability. <em>See </em>Antonin Scalia, <em>The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=56%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%201175" class="citation" data-index="72">56 U.

This is particularly important in strict products liability, where one of the main purposes is to incentivize manufacturers to research and implement <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>safer designs. If a manufacturer cannot predict with some degree of accuracy when its product is and is not unreasonably dangerous, it will not be able to efficiently adopt appropriate safety precautions. This uncertainty may lead some manufacturers to needlessly remove useful products from the market. The bystander contemplation test would move our state further away from the goal of an efficient deterrent effect on manufacturers by creating unpredictability. Manufacturers and all members of the business community need the ability to anticipate how their choices will be adjudicated in a court of law. Because it does not provide the requisite predictability, the bystander contemplation test fails this basic measure of a legal test.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[252,1126,1150,559]]]'>¶ 73. Although noted earlier, it is important to emphasize that strict products liability is not absolute liability. And a bystander contemplation test comes dangerously close to absolute liability by adopting an amorphous, ambiguous, and standard-less test that effectively gives a jury the power to find a manufacturer liable under almost any conceivable fact situation. This would impose huge and unjustified burdens on businesses (and through businesses, consumers as well). That is not what strict products liability is about, and that is not where we will take it.</p>
    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[250,1711,1150,515]],["BL_279.1",279,[137,381,1153,700]]]'>¶ 74. Another problem with the bystander contemplation test is that it changes the focus from the product to the injured party, creating discordant results. A bystander contemplation test would in effect create different levels of duty for strict products liability purposes, blurring the line between negligence and strict products liability. Manufacturers would owe a certain level of duty to the user or consumer, and a different, likely higher level of duty to a bystander. This is true because a jury could plausibly find a bystander to <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>have higher expectations with respect to the safety and design features of a product than the user or consumer of that same product. This opens the door to a jury finding the same product unreasonably dangerous under some circumstances, but not others, depending on who was injured. Under the Horsts' scheme, a manufacturer could be strictly liable if its product causes injury to a bystander, but not be strictly liable if a consumer suffers the same injury from the same product. Strict products liability, particularly design defect cases, should ensure that <em>products </em>are not unreasonably dangerous, not create different levels of duty and incongruous liability, depending on who is injured.</p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[139,1108,1152,685]]]'>¶ 75. The Horsts' suggested application of the bystander contemplation test is equally puzzling. They argue it applies only when the threat of injury is to a bystander alone. It is difficult to conceive of a situation where a product is dangerous to a bystander, yet poses no danger to a user or consumer. The Horsts say that is the case here, but surely there is some danger to the user of a riding lawn mower who is driving in reverse. Undoubtedly, the risk of danger is much lower than the danger of running over an unsuspecting child, but it does exist. This means that, under the Horsts' proposal, the bystander contemplation test would not be appropriate here, and may never be.</p>

Perhaps the Horsts do not mean to suggest a danger must be to bystanders "alone" for the bystander contemplation test to apply. It may be that merely a greater risk of danger to the bystander should trigger application of the bystander contemplation test. But this approach would likely require a legal and factual determination by the judge before instructing the jury as to whether the danger posed by a product is greater <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>to bystanders than to users or consumers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> It is not clear how a judge would make such a determination or what procedures he or she would use. It seems that if a bystander contemplation test were adopted, it ought to govern whenever a bystander is injured, avoiding any sort of early judicial fact-finding as to the potential danger posed by a product.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> This, however, is not what the Horsts propose.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[261,829,1163,911]]]'>¶ 77. The Horsts also argue in their brief that if we reject their proposed test, we "completely eliminate[] any duty owed by manufacturers to bystanders in cases where the risk of bodily injury is unique to bystanders." It is true that under our holding today, where a product is not unreasonably dangerous based on the expectations of the ordinary user or consumer, the bystander does not receive additional protections. But if a product is unreasonably dangerous in light of the expectations of the ordinary user or consumer and a bystander is injured, a strict products liability claim remains available. In addition, the Horsts ignore the availability of recovery under negligence. They are understandably dissatisfied with that avenue of recovery because the jury considered it in this case, and found that Jonathan's parents, and not John Deere, were negligent in the tragic injury to Jonathan.</p>

Additionally, a user or consumer's expectations regarding a product will often include safety expectations relating to bystanders. That is, users and consumers do not just have expectations regarding their own safety; they expect that a product will be reasonably safe for bystanders as well. Juries can certainly take this into account in their deliberations and evaluation of whether a product is unreasonably dangerous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

The Horsts also argue that our holding today impermissibly delegates the duty to make a product safe to the user or consumer. But this is begging the question; it assumes a product is unreasonably dangerous. If a product is not unreasonably dangerous (based on consumer expectations), the user or consumer has no duty to make the product safe for bystanders because, by definition, it is sufficiently safe for strict products liability purposes. Users and consumers simply have a duty to use the potentially, but not unreasonably dangerous product with the appropriate standard of care toward their fellow citizens, as they do in all of life.</p>

Finally, even if we accept the Horsts' proposed test, we have difficulty seeing how an ordinary bystander's contemplation (to the extent it exists) would be significantly different than a consumer's contemplation in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a> Everyone is aware that a lawn <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>mower is very dangerous.

The Restatement (Third) is better for manufacturers and sellers because it provides clear direction and a predictable standard. It is also better for bystanders because it places them on a level playing field with consumers and users. By focusing the inquiry on foreseeable injuries and thus providing a greater degree of coherence, consistency, and predictability, the Restatement (Third) requires manufacturers to be aware of the dangers unique to bystanders and plan accordingly.

It provides that a product is defective in design when the "foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design ... and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe."

This adherence is akin to insistence upon a horse-and-buggy approach in a space-age era.

    <blockquote id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[262,755,1005,646]]]'>A[n]... especially problematic aspect of the consumer contemplation test lies in the vagueness of consumer expectations in many contexts. Particularly in considering the design adequacy of a complex product — such as an automobile, a pharmaceutical drug, or other chemical product — consumers often have no meaningful idea how safely the product really ought to perform in various situations. How can an ordinary consumer possibly know the extent of crash protection or injury fairly to expect when an automobile crashes into a tree at 10, 20, or even 40 miles per hour? Lurking at the very heart of the consumer expectations test, the vagueness problem undermines the test in the most complex cases where a rehable standard of liability is needed most.</blockquote>

The Restatement (Third), however, offers coherence, consistency, and predictability because it is based on a more objective standard. Manufacturers are aware of alternative designs that may be available for their products, as well as the costs and benefits of those designs. A jury's determination, on the other hand, of an "ordinary" consumer's expectations about design and safety features is guesswork, with potentially disastrous consequences for the manufacturer if wrong. The more predictable standards in the Restatement (Third) will promote the efficient implementation of safety precautions better than the less predictable consumer contemplation test because the risks are, by definition, foreseeable and reasonably preventable.</p>

This is the danger of absolute liability — holding manufacturers liable for all injuries resulting from their products. No court openly desires such a system. The Restatement (Third) helps avoid unreasonably high expectations with its negligence-style evaluation of the costs and benefits, imposing liability for only reasonably foreseeable injuries or injured persons. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) 2(b) cmt. a; Owen's, <em>supra, </em>§ 8.8.</p>

One example is the open and obvious danger doctrine, which precludes recovery when a product is manifestly dangerous. Because consumers and users know of the danger, the level of danger is in accord with their expectations, and they are unprotected. But this result may neither be fair nor adequate to compensate injured persons where an open and obvious danger can be eliminated with the implementation of a simple, relatively low-cost safety feature. Owen's, <em>supra, </em>§ 8.3 ("[A] dire consequence of the consumer expectations test... is that it effectively rewards manufacturers for failing to adopt cost-effective measures to remedy obviously unnecessary dangers to human life and limb."). The Restatement (Third) rejects the open and obvious danger doctrine, providing greater protection to injured persons and greater accountability for product manufacturers. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) § 2(b) cmt. d. ("The fact that a danger is open and obvious is relevant to the issue of defectiveness, but does not necessarily preclude a plaintiff from establishing that a reasonable alter<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>native design should have been adopted that would have reduced or prevented injury to the plaintiff.").</p>

While this contention is plainly wrong <em>(see </em>majority op., ¶ 77), the Horsts are correct that the consumer contemplation test leaves bystanders less protected than they arguably should be. The facts of this case — where a bystander is injured by an allegedly defectively designed and therefore unreasonably dangerous product — serve to underscore and highlight the deficiencies in our current approach.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[245,1020,1153,931]]]'>¶ 101. Bystanders face several inequities when compared with users and consumers under the current system. First, bystanders are less protected when a product poses a greater danger to a bystander than to the user or consumer. The instant case is a perfect example; a riding lawn mower is clearly more dangerous to bystanders than to the person driving the tractor. Second, bystanders do not have access to the instructions and warnings that assist and protect users and consumers. Third, bystanders are, to some extent, dependent for their safety on the care exercised by users of dangerous products. Finally, bystanders may not be aware of open and obvious dangers that a user or consumer perceives. In all these circumstances, bystanders are stuck with less protection and less control over their own safety, and, under the current system, with less access to compensation in the event of injury.</p>

The Restatement (Third) levels this playing field by focusing the inquiry on the product itself, not the status of the injured person.

This analytical framework provides more protection for injured persons than our current approach.

The jury would have had to balance the costs and benefits and consider whether the risk of harm to Jonathan was foreseeable and could have been reduced or avoided if Deere had adopted a reasonably available alternative design to the RIO.
