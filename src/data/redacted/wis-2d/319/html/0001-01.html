We review a published decision of the court of appeals,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which reversed in part and affirmed in part a decision of the circuit court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There are two questions presented for our review: (1) whether Dr. Matthew Lindemann (Lindemann) was a borrowed employee of St. Joseph's Hospital of Milwaukee (St. Joseph's), and was therefore an employee of a health care provider subject to Wis. Stat. ch. 655 and <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20893.55" class="citation" data-index="0">Wis.

We conclude that Lindemann was a borrowed employee of St. Joseph's, and was therefore an employee of a health care provider under ch. 655. As a result, ch. 655 governs Gregory's claim. We further conclude that ch. 655 does not permit claims arising from medical negligence other than those listed in <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20655.005" class="citation" data-index="1">Wis.

Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals, and remand the cause to the circuit court to issue an order dismissing Gregory's claim.</p>

Due to <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>medical complications, she was placed on strict home bed rest. Marlene's pregnancy then progressed without incident until October 18, 1998, when another medical complication occurred. She was admitted to St. Joseph's and continued her program of bed rest in the hospital. Two days later, an ultrasound revealed that one of the twins was in a breech presentation. As a result, Marlene was deemed a high-risk patient who likely would require a caesarean section for delivery of the twins.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[249,864,1147,462]]]'>¶ 4. In the early morning of November 24, 1998, Marlene was awakened by constant suprapubic pain. The on-call resident, Lindemann, was contacted. Lindemann was an unlicensed first-year resident and an employee of the Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, Inc. (Affiliated Hospitals entity). His primary duty at this time was to assess and report findings and differential diagnoses on St. Joseph's patients to a senior resident or to the attending obstetrician.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[246,1338,1151,408]]]'>¶ 5. Lindemann ordered lactated Ringer's solution to be administered to Marlene at 2:40 a.m., for suspected contractions. It did not alleviate Marlene's pain. At 3:00 a.m., Lindemann made a differential diagnosis of her pain that included bladder infection, labor and placental abruption. He ordered a urinalysis in regard to a potential bladder infection. The results of that test were negative.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[243,1759,1149,301]]]'>¶ 6. At 4:15 a.m., Marlene requested that the attending nurse call Lindemann again due to continued pain. Fetal heart monitoring showed that the twins' heart rates were within normal ranges. Lindemann informed Marlene that he would take an ultrasound so he could consult a senior resident about her condition.</p>
    <p id="b110-7" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[244,2080,1145,148]],["BL_111.1",111,[192,398,1150,196]]]'>¶ 7. After the ultrasound, potent narcotics were administered to Marlene at 4:50 a.m. and 5:20 a.m., on Lindemann's orders, but he was neither seen nor heard <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>from between 4:15 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. He never satisfactorily explained his whereabouts during this time. There is no evidence that he ever contacted a senior resident to discuss the ultrasound and Marlene's case.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[192,614,1151,360]]]'>¶ 8. Marlene was still in pain when Lindemann examined her again at 6:00 a.m. At 6:45 a.m., Marlene's husband, Gregory, arrived at the hospital. Marlene informed Gregory that she needed to defecate and asked for assistance to get to the commode. At 7:00 a.m., while sitting on the commode, she reached down and felt toes extending from her.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[194,987,1151,468]]]'>¶ 9. Gregory rushed to the nurses' desk where he found another doctor, who delivered Adam Phelps at 7:20 a.m. Adam was immediately rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit where hospital staff attempted to resuscitate him. The efforts were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 7:36 a.m. Adam's death was caused by asphyxia due to umbilical cord entrapment and placental abruption, which impaired his oxygen supply.</p>
    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[195,1468,1152,306]]]'>¶ 10. While hospital staff were attempting to resuscitate Adam, Marlene was taken to the operating room.

    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[245,609,1152,775]]]'>¶ 12. The Honorable Michael E Sullivan presided over the initial trial proceedings. Prior to trial, Judge Sullivan dismissed the Affiliated Hospitals entity from the case, concluding that even though Lindemann was an employee of the Affiliated Hospitals entity, he was not the Affiliated Hospitals entity's "servant" because the Affiliated Hospitals entity did not control or supervise his medical decisions performed at St. Joseph's. Therefore, the Affiliated Hospitals entity could not be held liable on a theory of respondeat superior. This decision was not appealed. The Phelpses then moved for a declaratory ruling that St. Joseph's was Lindemann's employer. Before Judge Sullivan could rule, however, the Phelpses and St. Joseph's settled, and St. Joseph's was dismissed from the litigation.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[242,1398,1152,609]]]'>¶ 13. The day before trial, Judge Sullivan struck Lindemann's jury demand because Lindemann's lawyer had been late in paying the jury fee. A bench trial was then held. Judge Sullivan found Lindemann 80% causally negligent and St. Joseph's 20% causally negligent. Judge Sullivan awarded the Phelpses $990,000, to be distributed as follows: (1) $500,000 total to Gregory and Marlene for the wrongful death of Adam; (2) $200,000 each to Gregory and Marlene for emotional distress; and (3) $45,000 each to Kyle and Caroline for the loss of society and companionship of their mother, Marlene.</p>

It is clear that the court of appeals got it right and that the <em>Seaman </em>test has not been met. I agree with the following conclusion of the court of appeals:</p>
    <blockquote id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.5",149,[241,832,1005,1064]]]'>In sum, after addressing the <em>Seaman </em>factors for a "borrowed employee," we conclude that the test has not been met. There is no evidence that Dr. Lindemann left MCWAH's employment and agreed to become a St. Joseph's employee. Dr. Lindemann provided medical services similar to those provided by private physicians who are not St. Joseph's employees. MCWAH directed which hospital Dr. Lindemann worked at and paid him. Dr. Lindemann and MCWAH had a written contract, and MCWAH had the sole right to terminate him. MCWAH never relinquished any control over Dr. Lindemann. Indeed, as noted, while at St. Joseph's no hospital employee supervised Dr. Lindemann, and Dr. Lindemann was never given a handbook or any rules setting out St. Joseph's procedures. Thus, the right to control Dr. Lindemann remained in the hands of MCWAH's program director, MCWAH senior residents and private physicians. Finally, Dr. Lindemann's services benefitted the patients of the hospital and the private physicians but most of all, Dr. Lindemann's work aided MCWAH in its mission to train first-year residents in order to become licensed physicians. Therefore, Dr. Lindemann was not a "borrowed employee."</blockquote>
