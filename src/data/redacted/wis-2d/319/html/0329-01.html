This case is before this court on certification from the court of appeals pursuant to Wis. Stat. (Rule) § 809.61 (2007-08).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It involves a dispute between the children of the deceased, Robert Tensfeldt, and the two attorneys who provided his estate planning services, Attorneys LaBudde and Haberman. Both the children and Attorney LaBudde appealed a circuit court order on their cross motions for summary judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.7",435,[209,877,1157,482]]]'>¶ 2. Attorney LaBudde asserts that the circuit court improperly granted the children's motion for summary judgment, thereby concluding as a matter of law that LaBudde is liable for intentionally aiding and abetting his client's violation of a divorce judgment. First, he contends that he is not liable because the judgment was not enforceable. Second, he asserts that the question was fairly debatable, entitling him to qualified immunity and the good faith advice privilege.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.8",435,[214,1383,1150,426]]]'>¶ 3. We determine that the circuit court properly concluded that LaBudde is liable as a matter of law for intentionally aiding and abetting his client's unlawful act. The divorce judgment was enforceable at the time it was entered and at the time Robert asked LaBudde to draft an estate plan that violated the judgment. Under these facts, LaBudde is not entitled to either qualified immunity or the good faith advice privilege.</p>

      <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>¶ 4. Additionally, on the children's third-party negligence claim, LaBudde argues that the circuit court improperly denied his motion for summary judgment. We determine that the circuit court erred in denying LaBudde's motion for summary judgment because the children cannot establish that LaBudde's negligence thwarted Robert's clear intent.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[256,773,1152,564]]]'>¶ 5. Regarding the claim against Attorney Haber-man, the Tensfeldt children assert that the circuit court erroneously granted Haberman's motion for summary judgment. They contend that Haberman is liable for negligently advising their father regarding his estate. We conclude that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment. Under these circumstances, Haberman is not liable to third parties for his negligent advice, and further, the children failed to present evidence sufficient to show that they were harmed by Haberman's negligent advice.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[257,1361,1148,151]]]'>¶ 6. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the circuit court, and we remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Robert Tensfeldt and his first wife, Ruth, had three children — Christine, Robert William, and John.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> When Robert and Ruth divorced in 1974, they entered into an agreement stipulating to various terms of the divorce. The divorce court determined that the stipulation was "fair and reasonable" and incorporated the stipulation into the divorce judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.6",437,[205,854,1150,141]]]'>¶ 8. One of the terms of the stipulation provides that Robert would make and maintain a will leaving two-thirds of his net estate to the children:</p>

      <em>Will in Favor of Children: </em>Simultaneously with the execution of this Stipulation, [Robert] shall execute and shall hereafter keep in effect, a Will leaving not less than two-thirds (2/3) of his net estate outright to the three adult children of the parties, or to their heirs by right of representation. Except as herein provided, [Robert] shall have the right to make such disposition of his estate as he may desire, except as limited herein, and further, except as limited by the requirements set forth in [the provision dealing with unpaid alimony.] As used herein, the term "net estate" shall mean [Robert's] gross estate passing under his Will (or otherwise, upon the occasion of his death), less funeral and burial expenses, administration fees and expenses, debts and claims against the estate, and Federal and State taxes.</blockquote>

      <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>¶ 9. Robert married his second wife, Constance, in 1975. They remained married until Robert's death in 2000. Robert and Constance had no children together, although Constance had three children from a previous marriage. In 1978, Robert executed a will that was compliant with the stipulation and order — one-third of the net estate went to Constance, and two-thirds of the net estate went to his children or their issue.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[250,820,1152,715]]]'>¶ 10. In 1980, Robert retained Attorney LaBudde (LaBudde) of Michael Best &amp; Friedrich, LLP to provide estate planning services. It is undisputed that Robert made LaBudde aware of his obligation to his children from the outset. When Robert initially met with LaBudde, he gave the attorney a copy of the divorce judgment and stipulation. LaBudde told Robert that he had three choices: comply with the stipulation; negotiate with the children to alter his obligation; or ignore the stipulation, knowing that the children might contest Robert's will upon his death. Robert chose the third option, and in 1981, LaBudde drafted an estate plan that did not leave two-thirds of the net estate outright to the Tensfeldt children.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[252,1565,1146,151]]]'>¶ 11. After Robert executed the non-compliant estate plan, LaBudde received a letter from Robert's divorce attorney, J.M. Slechta. Attorney Slechta wrote:</p>
    <blockquote id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[323,1770,1000,449]]]'>Since you have drafted a will for Mr. Robert Tensfeldt of Oconomowoc, I recalled that in his divorce in 1974 in which proceedings I represented him, it was agreed in the Stipulation made part of the judgment, some restrictions on the disposition of his estate ....

There does not seem to be any sanction against disposition of assets during his lifetime.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[275,675,999,376]]]'>In my opinion, Mr. Tensfeldt's present Will needs some revision in light of the obligations under the divorce decree, of which I was unaware until receipt of your letter. On the other hand, the so-called "Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981" does, as you know, offer significant new estate and gift tax advantages which may be available to Mr. Tensfeldt to some extent despite the decree.</blockquote>
    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.6",439,[200,1098,1151,568]]]'>¶ 12. Robert and LaBudde never changed the estate plan to bring it into compliance with the divorce stipulation and judgment. Even though Robert and Constance moved to Florida in 1985, they continued to retain the attorneys at Michael Best &amp; Friedrich to handle their estate planning. Over the course of 12 years, LaBudde drafted and executed a series of revisions to the plan for Robert,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> including the 1992 plan that was in effect when Robert died. None of the revised plans left at least two-thirds of his net estate outright to the three adult children of his first marriage.</p>
    <p id="b439-7" data-blocks='[["BL_439.7",439,[201,1691,1152,413]]]'>¶ 13. Attorney LaBudde later scaled back his practice, and Robert first consulted with Attorney Haberman (Haberman) in 1994. In 1999, Robert met with Haberman to discuss his estate plan in depth. According to a memo from his file, Haberman "carefully outlined the assets passing to his children and his wifes children, and [Robert] decided to leave things as they are and make no changes" to the 1992 estate plan.</p>

      <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>¶ 14. According to the 1992 plan, after Robert's death the Tensfeldt children would receive some money and property up front. However, the majority of Robert's estate would pour into an inter vivos trust. Constance would receive an income from the trust during her life, and after Constance's death her children would receive a cash payment from the trust. The Tensfeldt children would receive the remainder of the balance.</p>
    <p id="b440-3" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[255,888,1156,779]]]'>¶ 15. When he met with Robert in 1999, Haber-man was unaware of a recent Florida case that would have a substantial impact on the distribution of Robert's assets. This decision, <em>Bravo v. Sauter, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=727%20So.%202d%201103" class="citation" data-index="0">727 So. 2d 1103</a> (Fla. Ct. App. 1999), allowed a surviving spouse to elect against the will (thereby taking 30 percent of the estate off the top) and continue to receive income from the revocable trust for the remainder of her life.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Because he was unaware of <em>Bravo, </em>Haberman did not inform Robert of the likely impact of this decision — that Constance could elect to receive a larger share of the estate than Robert contemplated and to defer the bulk of the Tensfeldt children's inheritance until after her death. It is undisputed that Haberman was negligent in failing to properly advise his client.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[252,1691,1147,295]]]'>¶ 16. Robert died in 2000. Robert's son and Constance were appointed personal representatives of the estate, and Haberman was retained as counsel. At that point, Haberman learned about the divorce stipulation, and he told Constance and the Tensfeldt children about its existence.</p>
    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.3",441,[190,407,1155,842]]]'>
      <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>¶ 17. The estate was probated in Florida, with Haberman as the attorney representing the estate. <em>See Estate of Robert C. Tensfeldt, Deceased, </em>Case No. 00-809-CP-02-HDH. This probate action turned into a lengthy dispute, encompassing two independent actions in the Florida circuit court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Initially, the Tensfeldt children sued to enforce the stipulation and order promising them two-thirds of Robert's net estate outright. <em>See Tensfeldt v. Tensfeldt, </em>Case No. 01-26-CA-HDH. Constance objected to the claim, elected against the will, and expressed her intention to continue to receive income under the inter vivos trust. The children objected to Constance's election and argued that it was untimely. Haberman, representing the estate, also objected to Constance's election and argued that <em>Bravo </em>was wrongly decided.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[194,1274,1150,359]]]'>¶ 18. The court determined that Constance's election was timely, that she was entitled to partial distribution of her elective share, and that under <em>Bravo </em>she was also entitled to receive income from the trust. Further, the court held that the children's claim for two-thirds of the estate was barred by the 20-year statute of limitations for judgments.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[195,1657,1152,464]],["BL_442.1",442,[257,398,1153,202]]]'>¶ 19. The children appealed both determinations. The Florida court of appeals concluded that Constance's election was timely and that she could both receive an elective share of the estate and continue to receive income under the trust. <em>Tensfeldt v.

However, applying Florida law, the court concluded that the children's claim for two-thirds of the estate was not barred by the statute of limitations for judgments because it was <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>enforceable as a contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The court held that Constance's elective share (30 percent) would be calculated before the children's claim for two-thirds of Robert's net estate. <em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=839%20So.%202d%20720" class="citation" data-index="3">Id. </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=839%20So.%202d%20720" class="citation" data-index="3">at 727</a>.</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.4",442,[256,635,1148,530]]]'>¶ 20. On remand, the circuit court awarded Constance statutory attorney fees of $444,000 for the entire action under Florida Statutes §§ 733.106(3) and 733.6171(4)(a). The court determined that the elective share issue was intertwined with the children's claim on the estate, and that it was not possible to isolate fees for the elective share litigation. The fees were to be paid out of the estate and subtracted from the Tensfeldt children's portion of the estate. Ultimately, the parties settled the dispute.</p>
    <p id="b442-5" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[249,1192,1156,533]],["BL_443.1",443,[192,395,1148,98]]]'>¶ 21. After settling, the children filed suit in Wisconsin against Attorneys LaBudde and Haberman.

    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[192,510,1154,771]]]'>¶ 22. The circuit court determined that as a matter of law LaBudde aided and abetted Robert's violation of the divorce judgment and set trial for the issues of causation and damages. Further, the court determined that the civil conspiracy and negligence claims against LaBudde presented questions of fact for the jury to decide. However, the court dismissed all claims against Haberman, concluding that he was negligent as a matter of law but that the evidence that his negligence had actually caused harm to the children was speculative. Specifically, the court stated that the children presented no evidence that Robert would have changed his estate plan had he known that Constance could simultaneously elect against the will and receive income from the trust.</p>

The court of appeals certified the cross-appeal to this court, noting that the claims against Haberman could be resolved based on existing law.

The Tensfeldt children allege that between 1980 and 1992, Attorney LaBudde assisted Robert in unlawfully violating a court order mandating that Robert make and maintain a specific will. During that time, LaBudde drafted five wills for Robert, each of them noncompliant with a divorce judgment. The circuit court determined that these actions constituted aiding and abetting as a matter of law:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

However, to do so, he needed help in drafting his will, and LaBudde provided this assistance. There is also no question that LaBudde intended that the will would violate the judgment. He was aware of the court's judgment and knew that the will he drafted violated it.

We agree that in most cases, an attorney is immune from liability to third parties based on the attorney's failure to perform a duty owed to a client.

Indeed, the parties agree that Robert asked LaBudde to draft the will in violation of the court judgment, and LaBudde was not negligent in performing this service. In contrast to <em>Yorgan v.

In such cases, the attorney's negligence frustrates the decedent's testamentary intent because it prevents the decedent's will from being enforceable. In cases falling under the <em>Auric </em>exception, there is no question that the decedent's intent was thwarted due to the attorney's negligence. In these cases, if the court did not allow the third party beneficiaries to bring suit, there would be no one to vindicate the client's expectation of competent representation because by definition, the client is deceased. Thus, <em>Auric </em>allows third party beneficiaries of a will to stand in for the deceased testator to ensure that his testamentary intent is fulfilled. This exception is a narrow one.</p>

Here, the circuit court ruled that the Tensfeldt children were entitled to bring a claim of negligence against LaBudde because the children were named in the estate plan he drafted and executed. It is true that under Wisconsin law, a plaintiff must be named in a will in order to bring a negligence action against the attorney who negligently drafted or executed the will. <em>See Beauchamp v. Kemmeter, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2001%20WI%20App%205" class="citation" data-index="70">2001 WI App 5</a>, ¶ 9, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=240%20Wis.%202d%20733" class="citation" data-index="71">240 Wis. 2d 733</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=625%20N.W.2d%20297" class="citation" data-index="72">625 N.W.2d 297</a> (Ct.

It is undisputed that LaBudde carried out Robert's explicit instructions when he crafted an estate plan that did not leave two-thirds of Robert's net estate outright to his children. To this end, we determine that the children's third party negligence claim cannot be maintained because they cannot establish that LaBudde's negligence thwarted Robert's clear intent.

The circuit court dismissed the children's claim that Haberman was negligent for failing to advise Robert about the likely consequences of <em>Bravo v.

    <p id="b466-6" data-blocks='[["BL_466.7",466,[231,1567,1150,671]]]'>¶ 76. The children contend that they were damaged in two ways by Haberman's negligent advice to their father. They argue that they received a smaller share of the estate and had to await Constance's death to recover their inheritance. Additionally, they argue that they had to undertake expensive probate litigation in Florida, reducing the value of their inheritance still further. They assert that if Haberman had properly advised Robert, he would have made a definitive decision about whether to allow Constance to continue to receive income from the trust even if she elected against the estate. Therefore, they claim, the probate litigation would have been unnecessary.</p>

Here, Attorney Haberman neither drafted nor supervised the execution of Robert's estate plan. His only role was giving Robert admittedly negligent advice. Extending the <em>Auric </em>exception to attorneys who give negligent advice stretches the exception too far.</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[188,1252,1150,307]]]'>¶ 78. Additionally, we note that the circuit court determined that the children's claim that they had been harmed as a result of Haberman's negligence was speculative. The court's review of the evidence revealed no proof that Robert would have altered his estate plan had he realized the likely impact of <em>Bravo.</em>

The Tensfeldt children argue that they presented some evidence that Robert would have changed his mind had he known about the likely impact of <em>Bravo, </em>and that this evidence is sufficient to pass summary judgment. Specifically, they point to Robert's <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>1999 approval of an estate plan that did not take into account Constances's right to elect against the estate. The children contend that this distribution scheme represents Robert's testamentary intent and is evidence that, had he understood that Constance could elect against the estate, he would have increased the distribution to his children. In addition, the children point to statements made by Haberman in Florida probate court when he argued on behalf of the estate against Constance's decision to elect against the will.</p>

Robert's 1999 approval of the distribution scheme is evidence of what his desires would have been had <em>Bravo </em>not been a factor. Looking at this evidence, however, there is simply no way to make even an educated guess about what Robert would have done had he understood that this distribution plan would not be carried out due to <em>Bravo. </em>A reasonable jury, looking at this evidence, would have no basis to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that Robert would have altered his estate plan had he understood Constance's rights under Florida law.</p>

Further, the circuit court correctly determined that Haberman's arguments in probate court are not evidence of what Robert would have done had he been advised about <em>Bravo. </em>Because Haberman did not inform Robert of <em>Bravo, </em>Haberman never learned whether and how Robert would have altered his estate plan. None of Haberman's statements to the court reflects any personal knowledge about what Robert would have done had he been properly advised.</p>

In sum, we determine that the circuit court properly concluded that Attorney LaBudde is liable as a matter of law for aiding and abetting his client's unlawful act.

I write separately for three reasons: (1) I conclude that the plaintiffs' claim against LaBudde, <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>based on aiding and abetting Robert in allegedly violating a provision of a 1974 divorce judgment that required him to will two-thirds of his net estate to his three adult children, fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted because the estate planning provision of the divorce judgment exceeded the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction; (2) I conclude that LaBudde was immune from liability in drafting Robert's 1992 will because LaBudde proceeded in a good faith belief that the provision in the 1974 divorce judgment that required estate planning in favor of the adult children was void from its inception, as a judgment; and (3) I conclude that even if I were to assume, arguendo, that the directive to make a will in the 1974 divorce judgment were enforceable when made, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20893.40" class="citation" data-index="249">Wis. Stat. § 893.40</a>, a 20-year statute of repose, precluded actions on the divorce judgment after December 5, 1994. Therefore, the divorce judgment had no effect, as a judgment, in 1999 when Robert reaffirmed the will that he made in 1992, and it had no effect at his death in 2000. As a result, the aiding and abetting claim against LaBudde must be dismissed. Because the majority opinion concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that addresses the aiding and abetting claim.</p>

Nothing in § 247.10 (1973-74) even implies that the division of property in a divorce can be made in favor of one who is not a party to the divorce action, an interpretation that would otherwise trump the explicit directive of § 247.26 (1973-74). Rather, § 247.10 (1973-74) simply permitted the parties to present to the court their agreement on how their property should be divided between them.</p>

It also opines that "[e]ven if LaBudde believed that the judgment exceeded the divorce court's authority under the 1974 statutes, the only lawful courses of action were to follow the judgment, to ask the court to modify it, or to appeal the judgment." <em>Id. </em>With all due respect, the majority opinion is wrong on the facts and on the law. LaBudde has consistently maintained that the divorce court was without power to order Robert to maintain a will in favor of the adult children, and that Robert's obligation to the adult children was contractual in nature. Furthermore, the law in Wisconsin does not require compliance with a void judgment. <em>Ramsey, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=16%20Wis.%202d%20154" class="citation" data-index="280">16 Wis. 2d at 165</a>.</p>
