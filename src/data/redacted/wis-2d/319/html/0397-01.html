This is an appeal pursuant to <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20809.61" class="citation" data-index="0">Wis. Stat. § 809.61</a> (2007-08)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which American Family Insurance Co. ("American Family") seeks review of the judgment of dismissal entered by the Circuit Court for Waupaca County, Raymond S. Huber, Judge.</p>
    <p id="b502-8" data-blocks='[["BL_502.11",502,[235,1446,1151,463]],["BL_503.1",503,[188,395,1151,510]]]'>¶ 2. American Family brought a cause of action against three brothers — David, Joseph, and Charles Golke, Golke Brothers Roofing and Siding LLC, and Indiana Insurance Co. ("Indiana Insurance")<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for damages alleged to have arisen from negligent roof repairs. American Family claimed that the Golkes' negligent roof repair caused a fire that damaged a home owned by its insured, the Ronaldsons. The circuit court found that American Family had failed to preserve any por<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>tion of the pertinent roof or chimney sections when it knew or should have known that litigation was likely. The circuit court further found that American Family did not give the Golkes sufficient notice of a claim against them or of the impending destruction of the fire scene. Concluding that this amounted to improper destruction of evidence, or "spoliation," the circuit court dismissed American Family's suit as a sanction for spoliation and entered judgments in favor of all defendants.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[191,927,1153,411]]]'>¶ 3. American Family appealed, and the court of appeals certified two questions to us. First, under what circumstances may evidence crucial to a potential legal claim be destroyed? Second, what notice must be given to a civil litigant before such evidence is destroyed? The certification by the court of appeals also discussed the proper standard for imposing the sanction of dismissal for spoliation.</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[193,1351,1149,351]]]'>¶ 4. We therefore address the following issues: (1) When does a party or potential litigant discharge its duty to preserve evidence relevant to a potential legal claim; (2) Can sufficient notice be effectuated by the mailing of a letter via first-class mail; and (3) When is dismissal an appropriate sanction for spoliation of evidence?</p>
    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[194,1725,1150,515]],["BL_504.1",504,[242,390,1152,716]]]'>¶ 5. We conclude that the duty to preserve relevant evidence is discharged when a party or potential litigant with a legitimate reason to destroy evidence provides reasonable notice of a possible claim, the basis for that claim, the existence of evidence relevant to the claim, and a reasonable opportunity to inspect that evidence. We further hold that such notice can be properly effectuated by mailing a letter via first-class mail. We also affirm that dismissal is an appropriate sanction for spoliation of evidence only if a party acts <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>egregiously — that is, in a conscious effort to affect the outcome of litigation or in flagrant, knowing disregard of the judicial process. Applying the law to the facts of this case, we conclude that as a matter of law, Joseph and Charles Golke received the March 13, 2000, letter, and that American Family provided the Golkes with reasonable and sufficient notice, thereby discharging its duty to preserve the evidence from the fire. The circuit court therefore erroneously exercised its discretion when it dismissed American Family's suit. Because American Family discharged its duty to preserve evidence and no sanctions are appropriate, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for trial on the merits.</p>

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[239,1246,1148,565]]]'>¶ 6. On February 13, 2000, fire damaged a home owned by David and Lori Ronaldson. The home was insured by American Family, which appointed a field examiner, Albert Hlavachek, and a fire origin and cause expert, Todd Haltaufderheid, to handle the case. On February 14, 2000, they inspected the home and concluded that the fire began near a metal chimney that extended through the roof. After further investigation, Haltaufderheid discovered that the three Golke brothers — David, Joseph, and Charles — had performed roof repairs on the Ronaldson home in 1994.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[238,1821,1147,410]],["BL_505.1",505,[195,399,1148,140]]]'>¶ 7. When the Golke brothers performed construction on the Ronaldson's home, they were all working together in one partnership. This partnership was insured by Indiana Insurance until 1997 when the partnership dissolved. After the partnership dissolved, David Golke continued to perform construction work as a sole proprietor and retained Indiana Insurance as his insurance provider. Joseph and Charles Golke formed a <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>new partnership, later transformed into a limited liability company, which was insured by Ellington Mutual Insurance.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[193,566,1150,666]]]'>¶ 8. On February 22, 2000, Haltaufderheid met with Charles Golke at Joseph and Charles Golke's business address. During that meeting, Haltaufderheid confirmed that the construction work on the Ronaldson home was performed by the Golkes. Haltaufderheid later concluded that their actions had reduced the clearance between the chimney and the wood underlying the roof, and that this reduced clearance allowed the hot chimney to heat the surrounding wood to the point of ignition, leading to the fire that damaged the home. American Family determined that repair was not possible, and that the home would have to be demolished and rebuilt.</p>

At trial, Joseph Golke initially claimed not to recall receiving the second letter, but when confronted with his signature on the delivery receipt, admitted that he received it on April 7, 2000. Charles Golke also admitted receiving that letter. Charles Golke called Hlavachek in response to the letter on April 8, 2000, leaving a message for him.

First, we discuss the standard for when a party or potential litigant discharges its duty to preserve relevant evidence. We conclude that this duty is discharged when a party or potential litigant with a legitimate reason to destroy evidence provides reasonable notice of a possible claim, the basis for that claim, the existence of evidence relevant to the claim, and reasonable opportunity to inspect that evidence prior to its destruction. Second, we address whether mailing a letter via first-class mail can constitute sufficient notice, answering the question in the affirmative. Third, we address when dismissal is an appropriate sanction for spoliation of evidence, concluding that dismissal is only appropriate if a party acts egregiously. After establishing the relevant legal standards, we apply them to the facts of this case and conclude that American Family had a legitimate reason to destroy evidence, and gave the Golkes reasonable and sufficient notice, thereby discharging its duty to preserve the evidence from the fire.</p>

In the case at bar, the parties dispute whether the general duty to preserve relevant evidence may be discharged, and if so, what a party or potential litigant must do to discharge that duty. David Golke (along with his insurer, Indiana Insurance) argues that evidence must be preserved until and unless all parties consent to its destruction. American Family asserts that a party or potential litigant's duty to preserve evidence is discharged once it has given notice and an opportunity to test or inspect the evidence. Joseph and Charles Golke (along with their partnership, Golke Brothers Roofing and Siding LLC) appear to agree with American Family that the duty to preserve evidence may be discharged with proper notice regarding the claim and the impending destruction of evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

On March 13, 2000, American Family's "routine, habit, and practice" was for an employee to check the adjuster's cubicle every hour during the work day and pick-up any outgoing mail.

Joseph and Charles Golke also conceded that the business address listed in the letter's heading was their address at the time, and that they met with American Family's investigator at that address shortly before the letter was sent.

The presumption is further strengthened by the fact that American Family's adjuster prepared an identical letter to David Golke on the same day using the same routine mailing practice for that letter as for the letter sent to Joseph and Charles Golke, and David Golke concedes that he received the copy of the March 13, 2000, letter sent to him. <em>See <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=183%20Wis.%202d%20587" class="citation" data-index="62">Id.</a> </em>(explaining that when a letter is sent to each of two neighbors, and the first neighbor received the letter, a presumption arises that the second neighbor also received the letter).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

The letter instructed the Golkes <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>to forward the letter to their insurers, and advised that American Family expected either the Golkes or their insurers, if applicable, to pay for the repairs to or replacement of the home.

The March 13, 2000, letter to both, and the March 23, 2000, letter to David Golke, explicitly noted the existence of relevant evidence, and provided ample time for the Golkes to inspect or schedule an inspection of the evidence before its destruction.

American Family was placed in a difficult spot because of the Golkes' unresponsiveness, and it had a legitimate reason to destroy the home<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> and acted reasonably under the circumstances.</p>

We further hold that such notice can be properly effectuated by mailing a letter via first-class mail. We also affirm that dismissal is an appropriate sanction for spoliation of evidence only if a party acts egregiously — that is, in a conscious effort to affect the outcome of litigation or in flagrant, knowing disregard of the judicial process. Applying the law to the facts of this case, we conclude that as a matter of law, Joseph and Charles Golke received the March 13, 2000, letter, and that American Family provided the Golkes with reasonable and sufficient notice, thereby discharging its duty to preserve the evidence from the fire.

American Family's theory in the circuit court was that the Golkes, when doing work on the house's roof, negligently moved the chimney too close to combustible materials on the roof, which eventually caught fire. American Family, however, did not save <em>any </em>of the physical evidence relevant to its theory about the cause and origin of the fire and to its theory that the Golkes (as opposed to the original home builder) were responsible for creating a dangerous condition on the roof.</p>

The circuit court found as a matter of fact that important parts of the fire scene "could [have] been easily preserved, could have been removed and could [have] been available for inspection and testing." The circuit court accepted the defense expert's testimony that American Family should have saved the chimney assembly, the fireplace, the "doghouse" (a part of the roof), roof decking and joists, and part of the interior chase, all of which would have fit easily in a garage stall.

The circuit court also determined, after conducting a bench hearing with all evidence presented, that American Family's failure to preserve evidence caused significant prejudice to the Golkes. The circuit court concluded that American Family had "destroyed what is the crucial evidence that is important for the defendants to be able to evaluate the claim and to prepare and present a defense." The circuit court accepted the defense expert's testimony that due to the complete destruction of physical evidence, he could not form opinions about either the cause or the origin of the fire.</p>

First, contrary to the majority opinion's holding at ¶ 58, a reasonable judge could conclude that American Family did not give the Golkes a reasonable opportunity to inspect the evidence in the present case before it was destroyed.

Even assuming that American Family waited an additional ten days to demolish the house, this delay would not show that American Family's conduct was reasonable as a matter of law.

A letter that American Family sent to the Golkes on April 6, 2000, requested insurance information and neither stated nor implied that the fire scene was still intact or that the Golkes might still have an opportunity to inspect it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_15" id="ref_footnote_2_15">15</a> American Family also failed to provide this information after Charles Golke called American Family on April 7 and left a message in reply to the April 6 letter.

The other rationale for the inference has to do with its prophylactic and punitive effects. Allowing the trier of fact to draw the inference presumably deters parties from destroying relevant evidence before it can be introduced at trial. The inference also serves as a penally, placing the risk of an erroneous judgment on the party that wrongfully created the risk.</blockquote>
