Crawford.\n(May 2, 1899.)\nAnnulment of Marriage on Ground that One of the Contracting Parties is Under the Age of Legal Consent. In Illinois the age of legal consent to marriage is seventeen years in males and fourteen years in females. The complainant was married to the defendant while he was under the age of seventeen years and ceased to cohabit with her before he arrived at that age. Upon a bill filed by him to annul such marriage it was held that the marriage was voidable, and that inasmuch as complainant had not cohabited with defendant after he arrived at the age of consent, he was entitled to disaffirm the contract of marriage and have the same annulled.\nBill for annulment of marriage. Cross bill for separate maintenance. Circuit Court Gen. No. 178,361. Heard before Judge Richard W. Clifford.\nStatement of facts.\nThe bill alleged that the complainant was a minor under the age of seventeen years. That on the 29th day of May, 1896, he was forced into a pretended marriage with one Hanna M. Swanson under threats of arrest on a charge of bastardy; that at the time of such pretended marriage he was but sixteen years of age and that he did not cohabit with said \u25a0defendant after he arrived at the age of seventeen years. The \u25a0defendant filed a cross bill for separate maintenance and proofs were taken upon the issues raised by such bill and cross bill. The court found the issues in favor of the complainant and entered the following decree:\n\u201cThis cause having come on to be heard upon the bill of \u2022complaint and amendments thereto, the answer of the defendant thereto, and the replication of the complainant to-such answer, the cross bill of defendant, and answer to such, and upon evidence heard in open coiirt, and the court, having heard the arguments of counsel, and being now fully advised in the premises, and on consideration thereof, doth find:\n\u201cThat all the material facts alleged in said bill of complaint and amendments thereto are true.\n\u201cThe court further finds from the evidence that Charles H. Crawford, complainant in the above entitled cause, was a minor under the age of seventeen at the time of the pretended marriage with the defendant, Hanna M. Crawford, on the 29th day of May, 1896, and he never lived and cohabited with said Hanna M. Crawford after he, the complainant, reached the age of seventeen; that the said marriage was null and void and of no force and effect.\n\u201cIt is, therefore, ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the said marriage between the complainant and defendant be, and the same is hereby declared to have been and to be null and void and of no force and effect, and that the complainant be released from the obligations of said pretended marriage, and be restored to all and singular the rights and privileges of an unmarried man.\n\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the cross-bill filed in the above cause be, and the same is. hereby dismissed for want of equity.\u201d\nCarey W.
