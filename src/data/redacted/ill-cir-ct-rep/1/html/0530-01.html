    <p id="b551-3" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[213,771,1143,795]]]'>In the Field case the common council by resolution attempted to grant the right to Field to construct across Holden Place a three story bridge to connect the old with the new building of Field then in process of construction. Holden Place was a public street, forty feet,wide, platted as such in the original subdivision by the ■ Federal government. The complainant owned property abutting on this street to the north of this proposed structure and claimed that its construction would materially damage his property as to access, light, air, rental and salable value, and it was held that the city holding the streets as it does in trust for the public use, had no right to permit any use or diversion from public to private interests; that the right attempted to be granted by the permit was a special privilege to a private person in public property and was therefore within the constitutional inhibition and void.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[213,1584,1143,545]]]'>In the Hibbard ease the offending awming was constructed and maintained under a special license and permit in violation of an existing general ordinance governing and regulating the erection and maintaining of awnings. The council revoked the permit and ordered the awning taken down. Hibbard sought to thwart the action of the city in this regard by injunction. The manner of the construction of this awning made it an encroachment and an obstruction upon the street. It was in fact as well as in law a purpresture. It was' held that the mere consent of the city council by resolution or order gives no vested right.</p>

    <p id="b552-3" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[316,514,1146,394]]]'>The principal question to be primarily determined is whether or not the ordinance, <em>supra, </em>under which defendants are claiming the right to erect the awning which is sought to be restrained in this cause, is within the power of the city council to enact. Subdivision 17, sec. 1, art. V, title, “Cities and Villages,” confers among other powers on the city council to “regulate the use of streets for signs, awnings, awning posts,” etc.</p>

Thus the necessary and temporary obstruction incident to the use or repair of a street, * * * excavations under the street authorized by the municipality and the like <em>(Gridley v.

The modern awning is to be found in all cities of any considerable importance as to population, wealth and artistic refinement, and is in these modem times looked upon as a public utility in places to which the public resort in large numbers, such as theatres, hotels, museums, art galleries, churches, etc., and have come to be regarded as a public necessity.

It must be conceded that there is no obstruction of the public highway possible by the erection of the proposed awning, no interference with the unobstructed use of the street by the public. It can not be contended that there is any obstruction of air of any moment and if there be an impairment <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>of light it is so slight as to be practically inconsequential, it is <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>The last point is the alleged interruption or limitation of view which it is claimed will result from the erection of the proposed <em>awning; </em>as we have already seen no right to outlook or view exists, save by contract. <em>Garret v.
