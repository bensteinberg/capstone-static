Counsel for complainant bases his claim for relief on the ground that defendants’ conduct results in the infringement of complainant’s trade name, and attempts to make a legal distinction between it and a trade mark. In this he somewhat fails. “Trade mark” and “trade name”' are nearly synonymous, for the mark is the name, and its purpose is to protect the trade in the goods dealt in by the rightful possessor of either the mark or the name. It therefore-follows that an infringement mostly arises from the giving out to the public or the trade of some article in the similitude of that protected by the mark or name which deceives and is a fraud not only upon the purchaser, but on the owner of the name or mark. It does not appear that the name of complainant is attached in any way to its wares, viz.: false or artificial as distinguished from genuine or natural teeth, or that it has in any particular way or manner acquired any fame- or reputation personal to itself and not equally shared by others in the same line of business.</p>

There is, however, endless confusion upon this particular question. In general, courts of equity interfere to restrain infringement of names or trade-marks in two classes of cases: (1) To protect a technical trade-mark or trade name, and (2) to restrain unfair competition, as where one party simulates the marks, signs or labels of another. If, therefore, the corporate name constitutes a technical trade-mark, the court will award it protection irrespective of whether the action of the infringer is fraudulent or intentional or otherwise. Hopkins, Trade-marks (2d ed.) p. 44; <em>Vitascope Co. v. U. S. Phonograph Co., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=83%20F.%2030" class="citation" data-index="4">83 Fed. 30</a>. If, however, a corporate name is applied or used to designate particular goods, or is used in "connection with the manufacture or sale of such goods, such name may be protected upon the principles applicable to- trade-marks. In this class of cases may be ranged the oft cited cases of <em>Celluloid Mfg. Co. v. Cellonite Co. </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=32%20F.%2094" class="citation" data-index="5">32 Fed. 94</a>; <em>Higgins Co. v.

Whether or not one corporation may restrain another corporation having the same or a similar name as the first corporation from using its name, where the name in question is not used in connection with the sale or manufacture of goods, presents a more difficult question. On the one hand, it has been held that the use of a corporate name similar to that used by another corporation cannot be enjoined if its adoption and use are in good faith and without fraudulent intent. <em>Saunders v.

It was held that, in the absence of fraud or dishonesty, the user by the defendant of its own corporate name without abbreviation, addition or other modification involved no misstatement of fact, and could not be restrained by injunction; but that the right of defendant did not extend to the use of the name of “The Sun” or “The Sun Life” without the addition of the words “of Canada.”</p>
