The plea admits a right existed to sue defendant, but alleges complainants did not commence this suit against him until more than five years after the time the cause of action, the right to commence this action against him, arose. The cause of action and right to commence suit must co-exist. The appellate court of this district, by Judge Adams, has, since writing the above, made a decision upon this question of the statute of limitations in suits of this nature which is precisely in point.

If the executor or administrator is not brought in either by way of revivor or by original suit, within two years time of the issuing of his letters of administration, the only decree that can be made is that the executor or administrator pay the same out of assets discovered or inventoried, after the expiration of said two years.</p>

The questions involved are not (except as to the right of sét-off), free from difficulty, but upon a careful review of the argument of counsel and the many authorities cited, I have come to the conclusion that the findings of the ihaster in regard to the same are correct.</p>

    <p id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.7",468,[324,1471,1146,908]]]'>But it is contended that they do not come into equity with clean hands, and the maxim that “He that doeth iniquity shall not have equity” is evoked against their right to participate upon an equality with other creditors. This case is peculiar. There were no creditors when these bondholders entered into the subscription agreement, nor when they respectively took their bonds and stock. There was no actual fraud as to these creditors at that time, because they were not then creditors. The fraud that was committed in taking the stock without paying for the same was a fraud upon the law, although a valid transaction as between the bondholder and the Celebration Company. The creditors were not parties to the transaction and the fact that the law gave the subsequent creditors a right to pursue the holders of the stock, and compel them to pay for the same, cannot in my opinion, be held to be such “iniquity” as would justify the court in declaring that they should not as creditors stand on an equality with other subsequent creditors of the corporation.</p>

Whatever fraud there was upon the law in taking stock without paying for the same, they have made good the wrong done when they now pay for the stock.</p>

In my opinion, as between such bondholders and their creditors, there is no estoppel and the principle of the maxim that “He who seeks equity must come into equity with clean hands” cannot be invoked to prevent the application of what might be termed the universal rule of equity in the settlement of insolvent estates, that all creditors shall share equally in the assets. As the bondholders are to share with other creditors in the assets it is evident that full payment of the stock will be required.</p>
