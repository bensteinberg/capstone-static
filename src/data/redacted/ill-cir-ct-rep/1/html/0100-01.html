If they failed to make a complaint when they should make it, or suppose that a police officer is brought up for contempt on the ground that he failed to arrest a man when he should have arrested him for gambling; affidavit is made by one of these complainants that he saw two men betting on the race track, and that he asked a policeman, who was standing by, to arrest those men, and that the policemen are engaged in protecting these gamblers.

To issue a general <em>mandamus </em>of this kind would be simply to substitute the court for the president of the board of trustees, for the village board, in the exercise of its legislative power.

There it was held in the general language of the court here that where an officer failed to do his duty, the court would make him do it.
