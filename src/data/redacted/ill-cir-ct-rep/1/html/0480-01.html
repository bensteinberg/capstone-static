When it lays down additional switches, sidetracks, and turn-outs, on the surface of the street, while it may or may not to some extent obstruct the general public; in the further use of the street, it does not prevent the general public from using that street. The use of a street by a railroad is recognized by our supreme court to be a legitimate method of travel in the street, and that it is to be used in common with the general public, and any ordinance or provision by which it is to have exclusive use of the street is beyond the power of the city to grant, because of the trust character in which the city holds title of the street and the power’ to control it.
