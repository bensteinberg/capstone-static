So, while we haven’t much disagreement about the law, the difficulty is in applying the legal principles to the facts of the case in hand. There are no eases that on the facts are akin to this case at bar. I am free to admit that had this plaintiff gone at the time it did, in 1897, to the telephone company, and then being without a telephone, had said “We want a telephone, we have a right to this telephone, we want the metallic circuit, we want it for $125 a year,” and the company had refused and said “No, we •can’t do that, the service has been improved since the passage of the ordinance; that that wasn’t the service contemplated by the ordinance, we have got the grounded service which we will furnish you, and that was the kind of service contemplated by the ordinance” and then the plaintiff had yielded to the demands so further made by the telephone company and had signed the contract for $175.00 a year, I think I should hold without any sort of hesitation that that was dnress.</p>

There were these interruptions; Graham seemed to complain more about the “busy” buzz than anything else, but I think that is immaterial. I think this evidence shows that service was growing worse and that they needed the advantage of the development of the science of the telephone and the telephone system and they really needed, for comfort, the metallic circuit service. He was willing, under the instructions of his superior officer in the plaintiff' corporation, to make the bargain he did make. Levis said “Do the best you can, if you have to do it, do it.” I don’t want to be understood as intimating that that is a good contract, because the <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=106%20Ill.%20App.%2054" class="citation" data-index="1">106 Ill. App. 54</a> says it is not, and I agree with it. It is only pertinent to the question of duress. In some of these cases, one of them particularly, it has been stated' that the courts differ in relation to this question of duress, but in order to constitute duress, the parties all agree the payment must be involuntary, and that is the question here. Was there an alternative way out of the difficulty? Were they forced to have the metallic circuit service? Were they at the mercy, as it were, of the telephone company? Was there this moral duress in relation to their business that their necessities-were such that they must have this metallic service and therefore had no time to stop and straighten out the difficulties and demand their rights? In other words, couldn’t they have gone on using the grounded service for just a little bit longer while they applied to the court for an injunction, as was done five years afterwards ? That was done and they could have-done it just as easily in the first place as was done by others five years afterwards. In these eases that hold there was duress are the cases of the gas company, a monopoly, a public-utility corporation; there was no alternative. It must be that gas or no gas. In the water case, the case of the water company of the city of Chicago<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">1</a> controlling the water works, that is a monopoly business, water is a necessity and our forefathers got along with very little water, but we need a good deal and socially water is a necessity; therefore in the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company ease,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">1</a> when they <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>took that property under their mortgage and found resting upon it the claim of the city for back water taxes and where the city said “Unless you pay, we will disconnect this water-service,” that was duress. They had no alternative; they must have water; that was a necessity; they could only get it from the city and therefore there was duress and money paid' in that way could be recovered, because it was involuntary.</p>

The goods must go now; the goods must come out of the freight house now, whether perishable or not, made no difference; they must be used in the business of the party, which is a business that can’t stop for a law suit or the slow processes of the court. Therefore in all of those cases there was duress.</p>

A void law. The supreme court had nothing to do with what the rest of the law was; it was-not involved in that case and they had nothing to talk about, and that was the only matter before them—the question whether the insurance company was entitled to recover back, the money which it was admitted was paid under a void law.

I can’t see, if I am right, that there is any question here for the jury; that there can be anything said about a doubt as to whether or not there was duress. It is all a question of law and it is one-sided. Of course, there is no dispute here, that is' to say there is no contention only upon the question of what that evidence proves as a matter of law, and so I am inclined to hold that there was no duress shown by this evidence at the time, practiced by this defendant company upon the plaintiff at the time of the execution of the contract in evidence when the plaintiff had a grounded service telephone in his place of business, which he had had for several years and I feel quite positive that the evidence here does show that their grounded service was becoming worse all the time, that is, the interference was greater as time went along and I think the best evidence of that fact is not the evidence of the people who used the wires, but it is the testimony of the general manager of the telephone company to the fact that the metallic telephone service has been increasing as the years have gone by; since the time it became practicable to install this metallic circuit service that the grounded service has decreased so that today it would be one of the hardest things to find in the city of Chicago, unless you knew just where to go, a grounded service ’phone.</p>

At the time of the original installation of plaintiff’s telephone and the passage of the 1889 ordinance, the grounded service was the only one in common use in Chicago. In the course of time American ingenuity, responding to new demands and necessities, the metallic circuit method was invented. This new device overcame somewhat and minimized .the difficulties encountered in the operation of the grounded lines by leakage of electric current and interference with the transmission of sound over the wires, occasioned by contact with foreign substances, such as gas pipes, electric light poles, -and other inductive disturbances. Plaintiff, having suffered somewhat from an impairment of service over its telephone, and having learned of the improved method of metallic circuit ■service, applied to defendant for its installation in the place of its grounded service. Defendant refused to install the metallic circuit service for plaintiff for a sum less than $175 per .annum. This condition being communicated to plaintiff’s general manager, he said, “If that was the best we could do, to get it by all means,” and-the contract was closed at the rate of $175 per annum.

The very absence of all discussion upon the relative rights of the parties, the failure to challenge defendant’s right to demand compensation in excess of $125, plainly inhibit any assumption that plaintiff in executing the contract was impelled thereto by duress. All the steps taken leading up to its execution seem to have been voluntary.

The right of recovery, however, was denied on the theory that the payment was voluntary, and despite the contention that the money was extorted by the power of the state, which it was futile to combat, and that the parties were not on an equality or equal footing.

It is as binding within the municipal limits as the statute of a state is within the bounds of such comim onwealth.</p>

      <em>Moses v. </em>Macferlan, <em>2 </em>Burrows, 1005, is in some respects a remarkable case. There Maeferlan induced Moses to endorse certain notes, without consideration and with the distinct understanding in writing that he should not be held to the responsibility consequent upon his act of endorsement. In violation of this compact, Maeferlan sued Moses, and in the court of conscience, under a decision of the commissioners, they holding that Moses, admitting his execution of the notes, could not invoke the circumstances of their procurement as a defense to the action, Moses paid the amount claimed into court. On Maeferlan’s taking the money out of court, Moses sued him to recover it back as money had and received to his use, .as money which <em>ex esquo et bono </em>did not belong to Maeferlan. Here was the grossest kind of actual fraud and base deception. No mistake of either law or fact, but an unconscionable swindle, to redress which a court of law gave that ultimate relief which a court of conscience had refused—a remarkable case of legal contradictions. While in many of the cases expressions may ^&gt;e found seemingly in point, when analyzed they are as impotent as legal factors here as <em>Moses v. Macferlan, supra.</em>

      <em>■ </em>The application of equitable principles found in the English cases at common law arise from the fact that by the English <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>judicature act the rule of judicial interpretation is “that when the rules of the common law conflict with those of equity, every court is to give effect to the latter,” and like judicial interpretation at common law at an earlier date rests on the fact that many of the strict rules of the common law were materially modified by the common-law Procedure Acts of 1852-4. Authorities from so-called “Code States,” where the distinctions between common law and' equity causes are abolished, are out of harmony, for that reason, in this forum, where the distinctions of common law and equity are still preserved.
