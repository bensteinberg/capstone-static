In that ease the question as to the right of Julia Lynch to inherit turned upon the question of her alienage or citizenship. The learned chancellor there held the right of citizenship as distinguished from alienage is a national right or condition and pertains to the confederate sovereignty of the United States and not to individual states. At the time of that decision, whether there was such a thing as national citizenship except through state citizenship, was a question much debated and of difference of opinion; Calhbun and the followers of the state rights school, contended that there could only be national citizenship through state citizenship. But the learned chancellor in that case held that neither the common law nor the statute law' of the state of New York could determine whether Julia was or was not an alien. He also held that the constitution of the United States, as well as those of the thirteen old states, presupposed the existence of the common law, <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>and that to a limited extent the principle of common law prevailed in the United States, as a system of national jurisprudence, and as there was no constitutional or congressional provision declaring citizenship hy birth, it must be regulated by some rule of common law; that citizenship was purely a matter of national jurisprudence and not of state or municipal law, and adduces the law of the United States to be that children born here are citizens, without any regard to the political condition or allegiance of their parents, excepting, of course, children of ambassadors and ministers, who, in theory, are bom within the allegiance of the sovereign power represented and do not fall within the rule.</p>
    <p id="b385-3" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[225,1003,1149,600]]]'>The learned chancellor in that case considers at great length the contention that, by international or public law, the child so bom was an alien for the reason that by that law the-child follows the political condition of the parent, and suggests that such a rule might lead to the perpetuation of a race of aliens in our own country. He concludes th.at the rule contended for in that case, that the parents of Julia Lynch being foreigners, she took on the same character of alienage as her father, is one confined to countries which derive their jurisprudence from civil law and is more properly a rule of civil law than one of public law, or the law of nations, and that it was not and never had been the law of this country.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[233,1615,1149,546]]]'>He also comments on the dual allegiance recognized by some writers on international law as attaching to a child born of aliens temporarily sojourning in the place of its birth, by which the child is held to be a native born citizen of the country of its birth, and, also, a subject of the nation to which its father owed allegiance, with a right to such child upon majority to choose of which country it will claim citizenship, and holds that even if such could be held to be the law of the United States, the inheritance being cast upon the child, Julia Lynch, during her minority, the place of her birth must govern and therefore that she could take the property as heir-at-law.</p>

Clarke, </em>and says that the chancellor after an exhaustive examination of the law, said “that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominion and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural born citizen and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession and the universal impression of the public mind. In illustration of this general understanding, he mentions the fact that when at an election an inquiry was made whether the person offering to vote is a citizen or an alien, if he answers that he is a native of this country, the answer is received as conclusive that he is a citizen; that no one inquires further; no one asks whether his parents were citizens or foreigners. It is enough that he was bom here, whatever was the status of his parents.” And in the case of Look Tin Sing the learned Justice Field construed the 14th amendment and declared that “all persons bom or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the state wherein they reside.”</p>

Any doubt on the subject, if there can be any, must arise out <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>of the words, ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’ They alone are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who are within their dominions and under the protection of their laws, and with the consequent obligation to obey them when obedience can be rendered; and only those thus subject by their birth, or naturalization, are within the terms of the amendment. The jurisdiction over these latter must, at the time, be both actual and exclusive. The words mentioned except from citizenship, children born in the United States, of persons engaged in the diplomatic service of foreign governments, such as ministers and ambassadors whose residence, by a fiction of public law, is regarded as part of their own country.” Also that “persons bom on a public vessel of a foreign country, while within the waters of the United States, and consequently within their territorial jurisdiction, are also excepted. They are considered as born in the-country to which the vessel belongs. In the sense of public law they are not born within the jurisdiction of the United States. The language used has also a more extended purpose. It was designed to except from citizenship persons who, though born or naturalized in the United States, have renounced their allegiance to our government, and thus dissolved their political ■connection with the country. The United States recognized the right of every one to expatriate himself and choose another country.” * * * “The English doctrine of perpetual and unchangeable allegiance to the government of one’s birth attending the subject wherever he goes, has never taken root in this country, although there are judicial <em>dicta </em>that a citizen can not renounce his allegiance to the United States without the permission of the government under regulations prescribed by law, and this would seem to have been the opinion of Chancellor Kent, when he published his commentaries. But a different doctrine prevails now.” And proceeding he declares, “The clause as to citizenship was inserted in the amendment not merely as an authoritative declaration of the generally recognized law of the country, so far as the white race is concerned, but also to overrule the doctrine of the Bred Scott case, affirming that persons of the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>African race brought to this country and sold as slaves, and their descendants, were not citizens of the United States, nor capable of becoming such.” (<a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=19%20How.%20393" class="citation" data-index="0">19 How. 393</a>.) And concluded by holding, “No citizen can be excluded from this country except in punishment for crime. Exclusion for any other cause is unlmown to our laws, and beyond the power of congress. ’ ’ (Among the exceptions may also be mentioned, Indians sustaining tribal relations.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">1</a>
