It may proceed at law to annul the charter or invoke the aid of chancery to enjoin defendant from acting <em>ultra vires </em>to the detriment of the public. If tho charter be a contract between the state and the corporation, as is conceded, the state has such a property right therein as will enable a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the cause, to ascertain whether the facts charged are true, and having acquired jurisdiction for any purpose, it may enjoin such acts on the part of defendant, as amount to infractions of the law, although such acts may be criminal in their nature. <em>The Attorney-General v.
