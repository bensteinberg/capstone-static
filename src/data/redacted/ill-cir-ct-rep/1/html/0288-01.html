Answer having been filed and issue joined, a reference was had to the master to take and state an account of the amount due upon the mortgage. While the matter was pending before the master on an accounting the premises were again offered for sale for taxes, and the east one vigintillionth of the premises sold on October 24, 1894, for $603.33.

The evidence taken before the master disclosed the fact that the mortgagee had an arrangement with the tax buyer, by which the latter was to bid in all the property in which the mortgagee was interested, a list of the same being furnished, and the mortgagee was to take the tax certificates from the tax buyer by paying the amount paid at the sale with the accrued penalties; the tax buyer was also to be guaranteed from loss by reason of any such purchase.

There is nothing in the mortgage contract which raises an express trust relation between the parties, trust relations being only implied under certain circumstances by a court of equity in order to carry out the real contract between the parties. And a purchase by a mortgagee at a tax sale as against all the world, except the mortgagor and those in privity with him, may ripen into a paramount title and cut off all other interests. But the mortgagor and the mortgagee, as to their dealings with each other, or with the mortgaged property, the law requires, that the same should be open and fair and in good faith; neither the mortgagor nor the mortgagee will be allowed to obtain any advantage, the one over the other by reason of any purchase at a sale of the mortgaged premises for taxes, nor will such purchase be allowed to ripen into an adverse title as against the other party, or those in privity with him. <em>Moore v.
