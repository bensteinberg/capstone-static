There is no question- in regard to that. When these defendants filed their petition asking for a change of venue it was contested by the state, it was bitterly contested, I might say up to this morning. Suddenly the state ceases to contest this application for a change of venue, first oh the ground of expense, secondly on the ground that the state did not know just what number of affidavits the defendants would bring forward.</p>

There has been some newspaper talk, I do not know whether it came from the state’s attorney’s office or not, which in a manner brought the burden of granting this change of venue-upon this court. Now, I wish to say that I am acting in this matter as I will in every matter that comes before me, strictly in accordance with the law, and I want to do justice in this case, as I will in every case, as I see it. If I am mistaken about any proposition, that is a different question. But as I said before, if the state is of the opinion that there is no prejudice existing in this county it is the duty of the state to contest this petition, it was the duty of the state to file counter affidavits, and not say, “well, the court has ruled against us on the preliminary petition, and if you have all these affidavits we won’t contest it because the court will prob<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>ably grant the change of venue anyway.” In doing that .the office of the state’s attorney is not acting in good faith.</p>

Not only ■could things of that kind be averted, if the state’s attorney would come right out and say there is no prejudice in this ■county and we will contest the change, or say, “well, gentlemen, it seems to me that there is prejudice in this county •and we will not contest it.” That would be the manly way of treating a matter of this kind.</p>
