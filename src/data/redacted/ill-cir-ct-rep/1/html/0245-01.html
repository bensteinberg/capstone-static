It seems to me there was a plain one, to-wit: The obligation to refrain from using it as a theatre, and if he insisted upon so using it, knowing of its unlawfully defective and dangerous condition, did he not come within the direct inhibition of the penalty clause of the ordinance which enacted, “Any person, firm, company or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with the • provisions of the ordinance shall be subject to a fine?” But, pursuing the argument further, may it be fairly said that the ordinance in question is defective in its provisions?</p>

It held that the owner of the fee is liable because of the inference arising from the fact that these appliances were to be put on when the building was completed. The court also intimates that any person to whom it is provided in the law notice may be given is liable without the notice, for the court says: “The fact that the buildings are to be provided with fire escapes ‘upon or before their completion’ indicates that the duty of' providing such fire escapes devolves upon the owners of the buildings.

It is true the first and second sections do not say who shall provide the fire escape, but we thing the fair and reasonable intendment is that the owner or owners shall perform that duty and we so held in construing the fire escape act of 1885, the provisions of which in this regard are the same as the act under consideration in the recent case of <em>Landgraf v.

In other words, the law imposed upon them the performance of the duty and the action of the inspector of factories * * * is only made necessary in ease they failed to do that duty. It has been held that the term ‘owner’ in similar statutes does not mean the owner of the fee but may mean the lessee in actual possession and control of <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>the building; but we are not aware that any court has held such laws invalid because of their failure to definitely designate who should be liable. We think it clear that under this statute the owner is primarily liable for a failure to perform this duty.” Thus it must be considered that the supreme court of our own state, in passing upon a statute strikingly similar to the one set forth in this indictment holds that the mere omission to specifically designate the person upon whom the duty of furnishing the appliances and requirements devolves, does not render the statute inoperative but that under the statute then in question that duty devolved at once upon the owner and without the notice provided for in the statute, and that a civil liability for failure to comply extended to the lessee, trustee or occupants in the actual control of any building within the description mentioned in the first section of the' statute.</p>

It is said, that appellant can not fasten any liability upon the appellees, unless she not only shows omission by appellees of a duty, but unless she also shows that such omission of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the accident complained of. It is often difficult to determine whether the cause of an injury is the remote or the proximate cause thereof. Where, in the absence of a fire-escape, a person in a burning building is destroyed by the flames,it is unquestionably true that the fire is the proximate cause of the death, but yet it cannot, be said that the absence of the fire-escape is not, in the view of the law, a proximate cause, if the presence of such fire-escape <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>would have prevented the death. So, if a person in a burning building where there is no fire-escape or non-accessible, is forced to seek escape from the building by descent from a ladder or otherwise, it may be a question whether the defective condition of the ladder, or its unskillful use, is, in such a case,, so far the proximate cause of the accident as to make the absence of the fire-escape merely a remote cause. Certainly, the effort to escape in some other mode than by a fire-escape might be directly caused by the absence of such fire-escape. But we do not wish to be understood as expressing any opinion upon the question, whether the obstruction of the double window communicating with the fire-escape, or an accident in connection with the use of the fireman’s ladder, was the proximate cause of the death of appellant’s intestate, or not. What we decide is, that the question, what is the proximate cause of' an injury, is ordinarily a question to be determined by the jury under the instructions of the court. In <em>Fent v.

This rule we repudiate as in the teeth of almost numberless decisions, and as unsupported by that reason which is the life of the law. We hold, orí the contrary, * * * that it is in each case a question of fact; to be determined by the jury under the instructions of the court. * " * If the fire is the consequence of the carelessness of the railway company, and the question of remote or proximate cause is raised, the jury should be instructed that, so far as the case turns upon that issue the company is to be held responsible, if the loss is a natural consequence of its alleged carelessness which might have been foreseen by any reasonable person, but is not to be held responsible for injuries which could not have been foreseen or expected as the results of its negligence or misconduct. ’ In <em>Milwaukee, etc., </em>

During a friendly scuffle the pistol was accidentally discharged and a person was killed, and the court says that, “It is undoubtedly true as a general rule of law that a person engaged in the commission of an unlawful act is legally responsible for all the consequences which may naturally or necessarily result or flow from such unlawful act. But before this principle of law can have any application under the facts in the case at bar, it must appear that the homicide was the necessary or natural result of the act of appellant in carrying the revolver in violation of the statute. * * * The mere fact that the accused was unlawfully carrying the weapon in question at the time it was accidentally discharged is not under the circumstances a material element <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>in the case, for it is manifest that such unlawful act did not during the scuffle between the parties render the pistol any more liable to be discharged than though the carrying thereof had been lawful.”</p>

But it was said that “if the unlawful act were done under conditions dangerous to the toll-keeper; as, if he drove through the gate at a rapid pace, or urged his team of mules on after they had been seized by the deceased, or if from their known fractiousness it was dangerous to stop them—the criminality consisting of two elements, the unlawfulness of the act and the unlawfulness and danger in the mode of its execution,” the-defendant would be criminally liable. <em>Estell v.
