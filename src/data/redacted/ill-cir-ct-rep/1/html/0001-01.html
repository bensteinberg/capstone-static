Where a person is not a party to a contract in restraint of trade, he has no standing to call upon a court of equity to interfere.

The complainant was a dealer in patent or proprietary medicines some of which he sold at “cut” or less than the regular prices. Manufacturers of these proprietary medicines had entered into contracts with wholesale druggists binding the wholesalers not to sell the medicines except at a prescribed scale of prices, and not to sell to retail dealers who cut the regular prices on such medicines. Complainant’s name was placed on the list of retailers to whom the wholesalers were forbidden to sell such patent medicines, and as a result he was unable to purchase these medicines from the wholesalers. Complainant applied for an injunction against certain of the wholesale druggists of Chicago, the National Association of Retail Druggists, and others, enjoining any discrimination on the part of the wholesale merchants against him in the purchase of any of those medicines that he may offer to buy at current prices, the same prices paid by others, and also enjoining the National Association of Retail Druggists from “blacklisting” him as an “unfair” druggist who cuts rates, and to whom none of these proprietary medicines is to be sold because of his practice of selling below the fixed price. <em>Held </em>that a temporary injunction could not be granted.</p>

Has the manufacturer of a proprietary medicine (which is a trade secret) the right to fix the price at which his medicine shall be sold to the consumer, is the direct question involved.

That result follows, they sgy, from the fact or conclusion of the law, which they allege—namely, that the contract is in restraint of trade. In one sense no doubt that is perfectly true, because one of the contracting parties is not at liberty under the contract to do what he pleases with the goods which he purchases. But it is necessary to see what the contract really is. The plaintiffs are the manufacturers of Elliman’s Royal Embrocation for horses and cattle, and Elliman’s Universal Embrocation for human beings. They are not bound to sell the Embrocation at all; they are not'bound to manufacture it. They are at liberty to do as they please, and when they have manufactured it, they are at liberty to sell it at whatever price they choose to fix; it may be a prohibitive one, or it may be such a small price that they cannot make any profit out of it. That is entirely for their consideration. There are no goods which the owner thereof may not lawfully retain or sell at such a price as he pleases. * * * Carrington &amp; Son are minded to buy Elliman’s Embrocation with a view to selling it again, that is to say, to buy wholesale in order to sell to others retail, and Elliman, Sons &amp; Co. make a bargain with them that they shall not sell it below certain prices. That part of the bargain <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>has not been broken. And, that when they sell to others, they will procure from those others an agreement that they will not sell it below certain prices. That part of the bargain has been broken. Why should not Elliman, Sons <em>&amp; </em>Co. be at liberty to fix the price in that way? Nobody has argued, and it could not possibly be argued, that they are not at liberty to fix the price on the first sale to Carrington <em>&amp; </em>Son. Why should they not be at liberty to make the further bargain with Carrington &amp; Son that they shall not sell it below a certain price? It is said that the contract is in restraint of trade. In one sense it is, but it is just as much and no more in restraint of trade for Elliman, Sons &amp; Co., to say that they will not sell at all. It seems to me, to say the least, that what is restraint of trade as regards Carrington &amp; Son is really the liberty of trade as regards Elliman, Sons &amp; Co. The cases which have been cited are well known authorities expounding a great principle, and showing what exceptions there are to that principle. But this case seems to me not to fall within any principle or exception. I do not think it is touched by the authorities at all. It is merely a question of whether a man is entitled, when he is selling his own goods, to malte a bargain as to the use to be made of them by the purchaser. It is said that the contract is against public policy, but that phrase merely embodies for the present purpose the great principle of restraint of trade, and to say that it is to prevent Elliman, Sons &amp;-Co. from exercising their own discretion, seems to me to be applying a well settled principle of law to facts to which it cannot have any possible application. If that principle is to be applied, to such a case, it must be applied elsewhere, but I cannot myself see that it has any application at all. On the question, therefore, as to the validity of the contract. I am entirely against the defendants.”</p>
