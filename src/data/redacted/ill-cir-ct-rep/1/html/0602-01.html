The complainants could not make that company a party defendant as a corporation, without by so doing admitting, for the purpose of these cases, that it is an existing corporation. <em>People v.

In the section first named it is provided that “no license shall be issued to two companies having the same name,” and in section 50, that “no name shall be assumed or adopted by any corporation similar to or liable to be mistaken for the name of any other corporation organized under the laws of this, state, without the consent of such other corporation.” Aside: <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>from and independent of the general rule laid down by the •courts, the legislature has by this statute by implication provided that an Illinois corporation may, by proper legal proceedings, prevent the organization of any other corporation under the laws of this state, with the same or a similar corporate name, when the consent thereto of such existing corporation has not been obtained.</p>

It also appears that the “Illinois Watch Case Company” sought to change its name to “Elgin Watch Case Company,” but that before such change of name was completed the complainant, “Elgin Watch Case Company,” was incorporated under the general laws of this state, and thereupon the secretary of state refused a license to change the name of the “Illinois Watch Case Company” to the “Elgin Watch Case Company,” presumably under the restriction contained in section 50 of the statute as to corporations above quoted, viz.: “That no name shall be assumed or adopted similar to, or liable to be mistaken for, the name of any other corporation.”</p>
