The substance and effect of this rule is found stated in many decisions, and is given in Lewis’ Sutherland on Statutory Construction in these words: “It is a principle of statutory construction everywhere recognized and acted upon, not only with respect to penal statutes, but to those affecting only civil rights and duties, that where words particularly designating specific acts or things, are followed by and associated with words of general import comprehensively designating acts or things, the latter are to be regarded as comprehending only matters of the same kind or class as those particularly stated. They are to be deemed to have been used, not in the broad sense which they might bear if standing alone, but as related to the .words of more definite and particular meaning with which they are associated./'’ Further, the punctuation makes the construction argued for by the state, to my mind, wholly inadmissible.</p>

In only a few of them is the power conferred required to be exercised through the enactment of a formal ordinance with the enacting words “Be it ordained by the city council.” (See sec. 2, Id.) Section 3 provides for the publication of all ordinances “imposing a fine, penalty, imprisonment or forfeiture, or making any appropriation.” Its closing sentence is, “All other ordinances, orders and resolutions shall take effect from and after their passage unless otherwise provided therein.” It would be impracticable if not impossible by ordinance for the city to exercise many of the multiform powers conferred. The corporation can not accomplish by an order or resolution (the words are used interchangeably) that which under its char<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>ter is only permitted to be done by an ordinance. “An ordinance prescribes a permanent rule o£ conduct or government, while a resolution is of a temporary character.” Again, “It may be stated as a general rule that matters upon which a municipal corporation desires to legislate must be put in the form of an ordinance, while all acts that are done in its ministerial capacity and for a temporary purpose may be put in the form of a resolution.” (See McQuillan, Municipal Ordinances, sec. 2, and cases cited.)</p>

But though penal laws are to be construed strictly, yet the intention of the legislature must govern in construction of penal as well as other statutes, and they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.” He cites in this connection Mr. Justice Story and approves the declaration of Mr. Sedgwick in his work on Statutory and Constitutional Law, 282, in which he says ‘‘ Courts refusing on the one hand to extend the principle to cases which are not clearly embraced in them, and on the other equally refusing by any mere verbal nicety, forced construction or equitable interpretation, to exonerate parties plainly within their scope.” Following this rule of construction I find the offense charged in the forgery indictment to be a statutory crime under the law in this state and to be clearly and adequately set out in the indictment.</p>
