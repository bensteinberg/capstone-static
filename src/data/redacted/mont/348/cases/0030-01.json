ZERBE BROTHERS, a Montana corporation, Defendant, Appellant and Cross-Appellee."], "opinions": [{"text": "JUSTICE LEAPHART\ndelivered the Opinion of the Court.\n\u00b61 The present case stems from an agreement between Tractor and Equipment Co. (\u201cT&E\u201d) and Zerbe Brothers, Inc. (\u201cZerbe\u201d) for the sale of farm equipment in northeastern Montana. Under the terms of the agreement, known as the Consignment and Sales Agreement, T&E agreed to consign and to ultimately sell certain equipment manufactured by Caterpillar, Inc. (\u201cCAT\u201d) to Zerbe for sale to Zerbe\u2019s customers in northeastern Montana. In 2000, T&E filed an action for a judgment declaring the Consignment and Sales Agreement void. In 2004, however, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Zerbe holding that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the protective provisions of the Montana Farm Implements Dealership Act (\u201cMFIDA\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 30-11-801 through -811, MCA. The District Court denied a cross-motion for declaratory judgment as a matter of law filed by T&E. In 2007, the District Court entered Judgment in favor of Zerbe after concluding that T&E violated the MFIDA by substantially changing the competitive circumstances of the Consignment and Sales Agreement. The District Court awarded Zerbe $243,874.00 in damages, $64,575.11 in attorney fees, and $1,490.45 in costs.\n\u00b62 Zerbe appeals, claiming the District Court underestimated its damages by failing to include certain profits received from trade-ins or profits made from sales outside a five-county area specified in the Consignment and Sales Agreement. Zerbe asks this Court to remand the action to the District Court with instructions to award $1.8 million in damages. T&E cross-appeals the damage award and the District Court\u2019s earlier determinations that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the MFIDA. T&E also claims the District Court erred, in a 2005 order, by concluding that Zerbe did not waive the MFIDA by agreeing to a termination provision in the Consignment and Sales Agreement, which allowed T&E to cancel the agreement for any reason with 30 days notice to Zerbe. We affirm.\n\u00b63 The restated issues on appeal are as follows:\n\u00b64 I. Did the District Court err in concluding that the MFIDA applied to the Consignment and Sales Agreement?\n\u00b65 II. Did the District Court err in concluding that Zerbe did not waive the MFIDA by entering into the Consignment and Sales Agreement?\n\u00b66 III. Did the District Court err in its calculation of Zerbe\u2019s damages?\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b67 In the mid-1990s, T&E and Zerbe entered into discussions about Zerbe managing the sale and rental of a high-end tractor known as the Challenger tractor, which at that time was manufactured by CAT. T&E, a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Billings, Montana, was the exclusive dealer for CAT products and equipment in parts of eastern Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. After a series of events not relevant to the issues on appeal, T&E executed the Consignment and Sales Agreement on July 7,1997. The agreement, which was drafted by counsel for T&E and reviewed by counsel for Zerbe, provided that T&E would consign and ultimately sell CAT equipment to Zerbe for sale to Zerbe\u2019s customers in northeastern Montana. According to evidence set forth in the record, T&E sought to establish a relationship with Zerbe because of Zerbe\u2019s well-established relationship with customers in northeastern Montana.\n\u00b68 Under the terms of the Consignment and Sales Agreement, the parts and equipment on consignment to Zerbe (\u201cConsigned Goods\u201d) would remain the property of T&E until purchased by Zerbe for sale to its customers. Title would also remain with T&E pending sale to Zerbe\u2019s customers, and Zerbe would keep the Consigned Goods at its facility in Glasgow. In addition to providing periodic requests for Consigned Goods to T&E, Zerbe was also required to furnish T&E with reports detailing the goods T&E had placed on consignment with Zerbe, and any losses sustained to those goods. It was also agreed that T&E would have \u201csole discretion as to which Consigned Goods\u201d to place on consignment with Zerbe and that Zerbe would remain liable to T&E for any losses to the Consigned Goods. In the event any loss was sustained, Zerbe was obligated under the terms of the agreement to purchase those goods. Under paragraphs 13 and 14 of the agreement, Zerbe was precluded from selling or contracting to sell any of the Consigned Goods outside the counties of Valley, Phillips, Garfield, McCone, and Daniels. Further, Zerbe was to \u201cuse promotional literature, data, and information furnished by T&E for dissemination to customers only in furtherance of the objectives\u201d of the agreement. And finally, but particularly important to this appeal, the agreement included a termination provision, which stated that \u201cT&E has the right to terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time after thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to Zerbe.\u201d\n\u00b69 On March 31,1999, T&E sent a letter to Zerbe stating that it was terminating the Consignment and Sales Agreement on April 30,1999. Through Counsel, Zerbe responded by stating that T&E\u2019s letter violated Montana law for the termination of agricultural dealerships. Over a year later, on May 4, 2000, T&E filed a declaratory action in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, claiming that it was \u201centitled to a declaratory judgment interpreting or construing the [Consignment Agreement] and declaring the rights, status and legal relations of the parties thereto.\u201d T&E also claimed that it was \u201centitled to a judgment declaring that ... the Contract is terminated.\u201d In a letter dated May 5, 2000, T&E stated the following: \u201c[I]n view of T&E\u2019s changed business circumstances, and in the exercise of its business judgment, T&E desires to exercise its contractual right of termination consistent with the contract, effective thirty days from today\u2019s date.\u201d Zerbe then moved for a change of venue to Valley County, Montana-the location of Zerbe\u2019s business. The court granted the motion, and T&E appealed the change of venue to this Court. We affirmed the change of venue in Tractor & Equipment Co. v. Zerbe Brothers, 2001 MT 162, 306 Mont. 111, 32 P.3d 721.\n\u00b610 Zerbe counterclaimed following the change of venue to Valley County, arguing that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA and that T&E\u2019s termination of the agreement was wrongful. Zerbe then moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether T&E violated the MFIDA by unilaterally cancelling the Consignment and Sales Agreement. On December 2, 2004, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Zerbe that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the MFIDA. However, the District Court denied Zerbe\u2019s motion that T&E violated the MFIDA after determining that factual issues remained as to \u201cwhether T&E directly or indirectly gave notice of termination in violation of this protective provision.\u201d In the same order, the District Court determined that the \u201cfor any reason at any time\u201d 30-day termination clause found in the subject Consignment and Sales Agreement was contrary to [the MFIDA] and thus, unenforceable. Based on this determination, the District Court voided the termination provision but enforced the remainder of the agreement, citing \u00a7 28-2-604, MCA, which provides that \u201c[w]here a contract has several distinct objects of which one at least is lawful and one at least is unlawful, in whole or in part, the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.\u201d The District Court also denied T&E\u2019s cross-motion for declaratory judgment, which sought to void the entire agreement.\n\u00b6 11 Thereafter, T&E filed a motion for partial reconsideration on April 4,2005, claiming that Zerbe waived the MFIDA by agreeing to the 30-day termination provision in the Consignment and Sales Agreement. The District Court denied the motion on May 5, 2005, after determining that the MFIDA was adopted for a public reason and could not be contravened through private agreement under \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA. A bench trial was held on April 4-6, 2006. The District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on November 8,2006, and entered Judgment in favor of Zerbe on May 18, 2007. The District Court concluded that T&E violated the MFIDA by \u201csubstantially changing] the competitive circumstances of the dealership agreement with Zerbe\u201d and by failing \u201cto give Zerbe proper notice and opportunity to rectify claimed deficiencies\u201d under \u00a7 30-11-803, MCA, which requires a grantor of a dealership agreement to provide \u201cat least 90 days\u2019 prior written notice ... of termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in competitive circumstances\u201d along with a description of the reasons for termination. The District Court awarded Zerbe $243,874.00 in damages, $64,575.11 in attorney fees, and $1,490.45 in costs. Zerbe appeals on the sole issue of whether the District Court correctly calculated its damages. T&E cross-appeals the damage award and the District Court\u2019s related orders with respect to the application of the MFIDA. Further facts are provided as necessary throughout the following discussion. We affirm the District Court on all issues.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b612 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is de novo. Mickelson v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., 2000 MT 111, \u00b6 61, 229 Mont. 348, \u00b6 61, 993 P.2d 985, \u00b6 61 (citing Oliver v. Stimson Lumber Co., 1999 MT 328, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 336, \u00b6 21, 993 P.2d 11, \u00b6 21. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. H-D Irrigating, Inc. v. Kimble Props., Inc., 2000 MT 212, \u00b6 16, 301 Mont. 34, \u00b6 16, 8 P.3d 95, \u00b6 16. Finally, this Court has stated that \u201c[a] district court\u2019s damage determination is a factual finding, which must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence; we will not overturn a district court unless its determination was clearly erroneous.\u201d Semenza v. Bowman, 268 Mont. 118, 125, 885 P.2d 451, 455 (1994). To determine whether a finding is clearly erroneous we first review the record to confirm that the finding is supported by substantial evidence. Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Com., 2006 MT 193, \u00b6 18, 333 Mont. 169, \u00b6 18, 142 P.3d 797, \u00b6 18. If substantial evidence supports the finding, we then determine whether the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Denton, \u00b6 18. Finally, \u201cIf substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended,\u201d we may still conclude that a finding is clearly erroneous, if upon reviewing the record, we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Denton, \u00b6 18.\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b613 I. Did the District Court err in concluding that the MFIDA applied to the Consignment and Sales Agreement?\n\u00b614 The MFIDA, enacted by the Montana Legislature in 1985, provides broad protections to agricultural implement dealers and states that \u201c[n]o grantor may, directly or indirectly, terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of a dealership agreement without good cause.\u201d Section 30-11-802, MCA. A \u201cgrantor\u201d under the MFIDA is a \u201cperson who grants a dealership.\u201d Section 30-11-801(9), MCA. A \u201cdealer\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson who is a grantee of a farm implements dealership situated in this state.\u201d Section 30-11-801(2), MCA. A \u201cfarm implement\u201d under the MFIDA, includes \u201cany vehicle, machine, or attachment designed or adapted and used exclusively for agricultural operations ....\u201d Section 30-11-801(7), MCA. Significant to this case, is the definition of \u201cdealership\u201d under the MFIDA, which is broadly defined as \u201ca contract or agreement, expressed or implied, whether oral or written ... by which a person is granted the right to sell or distribute farm implements, in which there is a community of interest in the business of offering, selling, or distributing farm implements.\u201d Section 30-11-801(3), MCA. Therefore, two factors are required for the establishment of a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA: (1) \u201ca right to sell or distribute farm\nimplements;\u201d and (2) a \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d While \u201ca right to sell or distribute\u201d is not defined, the MFIDA does provide a definition for \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d Under \u00a7 30-11-801(1), MCA, \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d is defined as \u201ca continuing financial interest that the grantor and grantee have in common.\u201d Although \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d is a determinative factor in the applicability of the MFIDA, further explanation or clarification of \u201ca continuing financial interest that the grantor and grantee have in common\u201d is not provided under the MFIDA, and we have not previously addressed the scope of this term.\n\u00b615 In its 2004 order, the District Court concluded that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the MFIDA and granted partial summary judgment in favor of Zerbe on that issue. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court noted a variety of terms and provisions in the Consignment and Sales Agreement, which, according to the court, established a \u201ccontinuing financial interest\u201d and thus, a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA. Specifically, the District Court noted that:\nZERBE had a locked-in purchase price prior to consignment and thus, its financial interest would be to promote the sale of these farm implements among its customer base for the agreed purchase price and more. T&E sought the promotion and protection of it\u2019s [sic] financial interest by the consignment of these implements for resale to ZERBE\u2019s customers, by mandating property and casualty insurance on the Consigned Goods, by obtaining monthly reports, by limiting competitive products, and by furnishing promotional literature, data and information.\nAfter evaluating these terms, the District Court determined that T&E\u2019s \u201ccontinuing financial interest in common with ZERBE\u201d was its interest \u201cto \u2018ultimately sell\u2019 the Challenger tractors for at least the price negotiated with Zerbe.\u201d Based on these findings, the District Court held that the Consignment and Sales Agreement constituted a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA. The District Court also noted that T&E failed \u201cto present material and substantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\u201d as to whether the Consignment and Sales Agreement was a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement. Ultimately, the District Court\u2019s determination that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA served as the basis of the court\u2019s later decisions and its damage award.\n\u00b616 On appeal, T&E claims the District Court erred by determining that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the protective provisions of the MFIDA. The basis of T&E\u2019s claim is that the Consignment and Sales Agreement did not constitute a \u201cdealership\u201d as that term is defined under the MFIDA. Specifically, T&E claims that a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d under \u00a7 30-11-801(1), MCA, must mean something and cannot be established in this case, even though the definition of \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d is broadly defined as a \u201ccontinuing financial interest that the grantor and grantee have in common.\u201d Section 30-11-801(1), MCA. T&E outlines a variety of claims in support of its position that a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d cannot exist in this case, including that the \u201cChallenger sales represented only about 10% of Zerbe [sic] revenues,\u201d that Zerbe \u201cdid not incur any capital costs\u201d or have \u201cpersonnel to handle the Challenger tractors,\u201d that Zerbe \u201chandled the sales of the Challenger tractors for only a short period of time,\u201d and that Zerbe \u201ctypically did not have any Challengers on its lot.\u201d T&E also claims that Zerbe shared no financial risk under the agreement and \u201cwas required to purchase the large tractors it handles as a dealer for Agco, Buhler, and New Holland.\u201d Finally, T&E claims that Zerbe\u2019s profits actually increased after it stopped requesting Challengers on consignment from T&E.\n\u00b617 In addition to these specific claims, T&E urges this Court to adopt a narrow interpretation of the term \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d under the MFIDA, arguing that courts in other states with similar acts protecting franchise arrangements have done so. Specifically, T&E urges us to adopt an approach set forth in Ziegler Co., Inc. v. Rexnord, Inc., 139 Wis. 2d 593, 407 N.W.2d 873 (1987), in which the Wisconsin Supreme Court established various guideposts for interpreting the scope of the term \u201ccommunity of interest.\u201d T&E finds Wisconsin\u2019s approach particularly persuasive in light of the fact that the MFIDA was modeled after the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 135 (2007).\n\u00b618 In determining whether T&E and Zerbe shared \u201ca community of interest\u201d in the present case, we look to the plain language of \u00a7 30-11-801(1), MCA, which defines \u201ca community of interest\u201d as \u201ca continuing financial interest that the grantor and grantee have in common.\u201d In this case, it is clear from the terms- of the Consignment and Sales Agreement that a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d existed as that term is defined under the MFIDA. As the District Court noted in its 2004 order granting partial summary judgment to Zerbe, \u201cT&E had a continuing financial interest in common with Zerbe, to-wit: to \u2018ultimately sell\u2019 the Challenger tractors for at least the price negotiated with Zerbe.\u201d The District Court provided additional clarification of its determination that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was a \u201cdealership\u201d agreement under the MFIDA in its 2006 Conclusions of Law. Specifically, the court stated that, in this case, \u201c[t]he community of interest was more than the mere sharing of common goals.\u201d Of particular value to the court was its determination that \u201cT&E also sought a profit on each Challenger sale\u201d and that \u201cT&E could expect to benefit financially from Zerbe\u2019s promotion and sale of the Challenger in northeastern Montana by making sales itself in areas adjacent to [the five-county area].\u201d The District Court also noted that \u201c[t]he clear, explicit and unambiguous language of the Consignment Agreement... shows the clear intent of the parties to promote and sell Challenger tractors in northeastern Montana.\u201d\n\u00b619 We agree with the District Court that the terms of the Consignment and Sales Agreement clearly evidenced a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d in this case. It is undisputed that T&E had an interest in having Zerbe ultimately sell the Challenger tractor in the five-county area described in the agreement-it is the only explanation for why T&E entered into the Consignment and Sales Agreement to begin with. Further, the evidence in the record clearly suggests that T&E specifically sought to establish a relationship with Zerbe because of Zerbe\u2019s well-known status as an implement dealer in the area, and that T&E benefited from the greater exposure to Zerbe\u2019s potential buyers. Zerbe likewise benefited from adding a high-end tractor such as the Challenger to its inventory. In this case, each party had something to gain financially in the agreement, and consequently, each party had something to lose if there was a substantial alteration or termination of the agreement. This financial co-dependence represents an ongoing financial relationship that establishes a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d under the MFIDA. While the definition of \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d is broad, it is not ambiguous and thus, we see no need to look to another state\u2019s approach in interpreting its scope. Further, a broad reading of the statute supports the underlying purpose of the MFIDA, which is clearly to provide protections to rural dealers and communities from the harsh results of dealership cancellation without good cause. To the extent that T&E argues for a narrowing of the definition of \u201ccommunity of interest,\u201d that is a policy matter which should be addressed to the legislature. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the Consignment and Sales Agreement was subject to the MFIDA.\n\u00b620 II. Did the District Court err in concluding that Zerbe did not waive the MFIDA by entering into the Consignment and Sales Agreement?\n\u00b621 In its 2005 order, the District Court determined that Zerbe did not waive the MFIDA by agreeing to the termination provision in the Consignment and Sales Agreement. The District Court applied \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, which provides the following:\nAny person may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for that person\u2019s benefit. A law established for a public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement.\nTo determine whether the MFDIA was \u201cestablished for a public reason,\u201d the District Court examined the MFIDA\u2019s legislative history and determined that it was \u201cdesigned not just to benefit the farm implement dealer but to protect such dealer and the community where the dealer is located from the termination or substantial alteration of a dealership franchise without good cause.\u201d The District Court correctly observed that the Montana Legislature showed a concern for \u201cthe loss of profitable, taxpaying, job producing, community serving businesses,\u201d and the \u201cunequal economic or political power resulting from the acquisition of competing farm implement manufacturers by \u2018a large conglomerate.\u2019\u201d See MT Sen. Comm. on Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation, Review of Senate Bill 407 (Feb. 18, 1985). Based on these findings, the District Court determined that the MFIDA was \u201ca legislative attempt to compensate for this unequal economic and political power\u201d and that \u201c[allowing a grantor to seek a \u2018for any reason at any time\u2019 waiver from those persons the statute intended to protect would defeat the very purpose of the Act.\u201d\n\u00b622 According to T&E, however, Zerbe \u201cwaived the protections of the Act when it voluntarily signed the Consignment Agreement with a 30-day termination clause.\u201d Stated differently, T&E claims that \u201cby signing the Consignment Agreement, Zerbe waived any right to invoke statutory terms that contradict the contract as a predicate for pursuing a damages claim.\u201d Specifically, T&E claims that Zerbe cannot claim the protections of the MFIDA for the following reasons: (1) Zerbe was aware of the clause when it signed the agreement; (2) Zerbe consulted with an attorney about the agreement and specifically inquired about the termination clause; and (3) Zerbe did not object to the termination clause at the time the agreement was made. T&E also claims it would not have entered into the clause if they had known the MFIDA would apply to the Consignment and Sales Agreement.\n\u00b623 The primary focus of T&E\u2019s argument, however, is that the public benefit exception cannot apply in this case. Specifically, T&E claims that the Consignment and Sales Agreement\u2019s termination provision was intended solely for Zerbe\u2019s benefit and that Zerbe, as a result, voluntarily waived the protections of the MFIDA. In support of this argument, T&E suggests that \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, has typically been applied by this Court in the context of employment agreements and cannot, therefore, apply in the context of the MFIDA. We do not agree. As noted by the District Court, we reasoned in Campbell v. Mahoney, 2001 MT 146, 306 Mont. 45, 29 P.3d 1034, that the non-wavier \u201cpublic reason\u201d exception can apply in situations where the State Legislature has attempted to \u201ccompensate for unequal economic or political power between groups such as employers and employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By citing an example, we did not limit the application of \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, to statutory protections relating to the employer/employee relationship. T&E appears to claim that, by entering into a private contractual arrangement, a party waives any provision of the MFIDA that is contrary to the agreement. However, that would be contrary to the very purpose the MFIDA was designed to achieve. The District Court specifically concluded that the MFIDA \u201cwas a legislative attempt to compensate for this unequal economic and political power\u201d and that \u201callowing a grantor to seek a for any reason at any time\u2019 waiver from those persons the statute intended to protect would defeat the very purpose of the Act.\u201d It also reasoned that the legislators showed concern for the dealer and for the community in which the dealer operated. We agree that the MFIDA was enacted for a public purpose and that Zerbe did not waive the protective provisions of the MFIDA by entering into the Consignment and Sales Agreement.\n\u00b624 III; Did the District Court err in its calculation of Zerbe\u2019s damages?\n\u00b625 After concluding that T&E violated the MFIDA by substantially changing the competitive circumstances of the Consignment and Sales Agreement, the District Court awarded damages in favor of Zerbe pursuant to \u00a7 30-11-809, MCA, which permits the award of civil damages to a dealer who has suffered \u201cpecuniary loss.\u201d The District Court calculated Zerbe\u2019s damages in the findings of fact from November 8, 2006, as follows:\n(a) Start with the average annual gross profit/Challenger sale of $9,110.00; (b) deduct therefrom an 11.6% operating overhead; (c) multiply the net profit/sale ($8,053.25) by an average of 3.2 Challenger sales every 12 consecutive months; (d) multiply the average annual net profit for Challenger sales ($25,770.40) by the reasonably expected product work life of 20 years; and (e) apply at 8.5% discount rate to the $515,408.00 total. The net present value, after application of this 8.5% discount rate, is $243,874.00.\nTo reach this calculation, the District Court evaluated the testimony of four expert witnesses who each presented a distinct method for calculating Zerbe\u2019s damages. The District Court, however, did not find the majority of this testimony credible. Specifically, the District Court rejected the opinion of James Smrcka (\u201cSmrcka\u201d), a Certified Public Accountant who testified at trial that Zerbe sustained $1,917,888 in damages. Smrcka\u2019s calculation was based on what the District Court referred to as a \u201cwash-out tree\u201d accounting method, which allegedly traced the profits from trade-ins associated with the sale of each Challenger tractor. However, according to the District Court, the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d accounting method was not a suitable method for calculating Zerbe\u2019s damages. The District Court reasoned that the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method was not appropriate because T&E retained no ownership interest in the trade-ins, was not entitled to any benefits from the trade-ins, and \u201cwas neither willing nor obligated to assume any of the risk related to accepting a trade.\u201d Additionally, the District Court noted that, under the Consignment and Sales Agreement, Zerbe was required to purchase the Challenger tractors prior to selling them to its customers. \u201cThis contract obligation,\u201d according to the District Court, \u201cmeant Zerbe had to come up with the cash to pay T&E in full regardless of whether or not it accepted a trade to complete a Challenger sale.\u201d Further, the District Court reasoned that the \u201cwashout\u201d transactions \u201cwere not part of the competitive circumstances established by the Consignment Agreement\u201d and that \u201c[f]or purposes of this case, these \u2018wash out\u2019 transactions were separate transactions\u201d and thus, could not be included in the calculation of Zerbe\u2019s damages. The District Court also rejected Smrcka\u2019s opinion that Zerbe\u2019s annual average sale estimate was 4.7 Challenger tractors. According to the District Court, \u201cZerbe\u2019s \u2018competitive circumstances\u2019 did not include a contractual right to sell Challengers\u201d outside the five-county area specified in the Consignment and Sales Agreement without T&E\u2019s consent, and T&E had no obligation to honor such sales. Accordingly, the District Court adjusted the annual average sale rate to 3.2 Challengers per year.\n\u00b626 On appeal, Zerbe claims the District Court underestimated its damages, and specifically, that its findings which served as the basis of the damage determination were \u201cinadequate, speculative, and outside the record.\u201d Zerbe\u2019s primary claim is that the District Court erred by not including profits from trade-ins associated with the sale of each Challenger tractor or profits from Challenger tractor sales made outside the five-county area specified in the Consignment and\nSales Agreement. Zerbe contends that the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method advocated by Smrcka was a valid method for calculating Zerbe\u2019s damages. Zerbe reasons that the sale of each Challenger tractor was \u201cintrinsically linked to the sale of the trade-in tractor or implement\u201d and that the District Court\u2019s exclusion of these profits resulted in a significant reduction in the calculation of Zerbe\u2019s lost profits. Zerbe claims that, because of the expense of purchasing a new Challenger tractor, purchasers were almost always required to trade-in a used tractor. The value received from the trade-in was then discounted from the price of the new Challenger tractor. Zerbe would then sell the trade-in tractor and so forth until a final profit, according to Zerbe, could be ascertained. Zerbe claims, that \u201cafter \u2018shaking out\u2019 or disposing of all the multiple trades,\u201d its average annual profit per Challenger tractor was $24,989 or $15,879 more than the average annual profit calculated by the District Court. As to profits made outside the five-county area specified in the Consignment and Sales Agreement, Zerbe argues that the District Court should have included these profits within its calculation because T&E worked with Zerbe to facilitate Challenger sales outside the five-county area. T&E counters by arguing that the \u201cDistrict Court was correct in rejecting Zerbe\u2019s astronomical damages claim\u201d and the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method advocated by Smrcka. In support of its argument, T&E claims that \u201call numbers used in the washout tree were based on guesstimates or assumptions.\u201d T&E cites testimony given by Smrcka at trial in which he agreed that the value of the trade-ins could not be determined until they were actually sold. T&E states that, if anything, the District Court actually overstated Zerbe\u2019s damages by applying an \u201centirely speculative\u201d twenty-year period for Zerbe\u2019s projected lost profits and by failing to \u201cproperly account for risk in the discount rate.\u201d T&E also claims the \u201cfuture sales projections exceeded actual financial risk.\u201d\n\u00b627 As noted in the standard of review section, a district court\u2019s damage determination is a factual finding that this Court will uphold if is supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous. See Semenza, 268 Mont. at 125, 885 P.2d at 445. We have also stated that \u201csince the district court is in the best position to determine the proper amount of damages ... its decision will not be disturbed \u2018unless the amount awarded is so grossly out of proportion to the injury as to shock the conscience.\u2019 \u201d Harding v. Savoy, 2004 MT 280, \u00b6 45, 323 Mont. 261, \u00b6 45, 100 P.3d 976, \u00b6 45 (internal citations omitted). Further, while a damages judgment \u201cmust be supported by substantial evidence that is not mere guess or speculation,\u201d \u201cmathematical precision is not required.\u201d In re Mease, 2004 MT 59, \u00b6 42, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 42, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 42. Finally, \u201cProof of damages must consist of a reasonable basis for computation and the best evidence obtainable under the circumstances which will enable a judge to arrive at a reasonably close estimate of the loss.\u201d In re Mease, \u00b6 42.\n\u00b628 In this case, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s determination that Zerbe sustained $243,874 in damages. Because T&E and Zerbe collectively challenge specific figures used by the District Court to calculate Zerbe\u2019s damages, we address only those figures contested on appeal. First, with respect to the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d advocated by Zerbe, we note that the central question before the District Court on this issue concerned the average gross profit received per Challenger sale. In this case, the record included transactional data for each Challenger tractor sold, including the price paid by the buyer and the amount Zerbe remitted to T&E. The record also noted that, regardless of whether Zerbe ultimately accepted a trade-in from a customer, it paid T&E in cash for the full amount of the Challenger as determined by T&E. Based on this information, the court established a gross profit per sale of $9,110. While Zerbe contends that its profit per sale should have been $24,989, as determined by using the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method, we conclude that the District Court did not err in rejecting this claim. Zerbe\u2019s \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method used estimates of future profits from potential trade-ins-numbers that were neither certain nor ascertainable. As T&E points out, Zerbe\u2019s own witness, Smrcka, admitted at trial that the price for the trade-ins could not be ascertained until they were actually sold by Zerbe. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s determination of the profit per sale and its rejection of the \u201cwash-out tree\u201d method in this case.\n\u00b629 [3] In addition, the District Court\u2019s decision to adjust the annual average sales rate from 4.7 to 3.2 was, contrary to Zerbe\u2019s assertions, also supported by the record in this case. The Consignment and Sales Agreement specifically provided that Zerbe was limited to a five-county selling area in northeastern Montana and T&E had no obligation under the terms of the agreement to accept sales from outside this area. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err by limiting the average annual sale average to the counties provided for in the agreement. We also note that the District Court\u2019s use of a 20-year time period was based on information in the record that the Challenger had been on sale for 20 years and that there was no reason to expect that it would not be available 20 years from the time the District Court issued its findings. We determine that this was a reasonable conclusion based on the record. Finally, T&E\u2019s claim that the District Court used an improper discount rate in its calculation is equally unpersuasive. The District Court\u2019s use of an 8.5% discount rate was derived from competing discount rates introduced at trial by Zerbe and T&E. The District Court\u2019s conclusion that Zerbe\u2019s proposed rate was too low and that T&E\u2019s proposed rate was too high was based on the District Court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. In Tefft v. State, 271 Mont. 82, 894 P.2d 317, 325 (1995), we stated that \u201c[t]he trial judge has the duty to resolve conflicts in evidence and this Court gives due regard to the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d We also stated that \u201ca district court is not bound by the opinion of a particular party or expert but remains free to adopt any reasonable valuation that is supported by the record.\u201d Tefft, 271 Mont. at 82, 894 P.2d at 325 (citing Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, 255 Mont. 430, 440, 843 P.2d 765, 771 (1992)). In this case, the District Court was in the best position to evaluate the competing positions of the witnesses as to the discount rate, and there was substantial evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s findings on this issue. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in calculating Zerbe\u2019s damages.\n\u00b630 Affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.", "type": "majority", "author": "JUSTICE LEAPHART"}], "attorneys": ["For Appellant and Cross-Appellee: Robert Hurly, Attorney at Law; Glasgow; Mfatthew W.
