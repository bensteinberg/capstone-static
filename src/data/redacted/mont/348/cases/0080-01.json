We affirm.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\u00b62 Appellants in this case are all owners and operators of alternative livestock game farms (Game Farms) within the state of Montana. To operate a Game Farm, the owner/operator must have a valid alternative Game Farm license (License) issued by FWP. The requirements for the Licenses are found in Title 87, chapter 4, part 4 of the Montana Code Annotated and are fairly demanding due to the threat posed by chronic wasting disease (CWD). The appellants in this case all obtained their Licenses at varying times throughout the 1990\u2019s and have complied with the requirements of part 4 since that time.\n\u00b63 Kim and Cindy Kafka (Kafkas) are members of Diamond K Ranch Enterprises, LLC, located in Hill County. In 1996, the Kafkas applied for a License with FWP and entered into a lease for a tract of land on which to operate an alternative livestock breeding operation. After receiving their License, they began operating in March 1997. In 1998, after obtaining a second License, the Kafkas expanded their operations to focus on the fee-shooting of alternative livestock as their primary revenue source. This operation was conducted on an 1100-acre parcel of land roughly twenty miles from the site of the original breeding operation. The Kafkas purchased this land through a series of three transactions, beginning in 1993 and ending with the finalization of a deed in 2003. In addition to purchasing land and going through the License application process, the Kafkas invested several hundred thousand dollars in other start-up costs, including fencing and the acquisition of stock. According to the record, these costs totaled roughly $463,000. In 1999, the Kafkas reported $11,000 in income from their Game Farm operations on their federal tax returns, with that figure rising significantly during the year 2000.\n\u00b64 Jim and Barbara Bouma (Boumas) operate a Game Farm in Teton County. The Boumas began their Game Farm operations in May 1997, by operating a breeder facility which would allow them to market large shooter bulls to other Game Farms which allowed fee-shooting. Like the Kafkas, the Boumas hold Licenses issued by FWP. The Boumas\u2019 breeder operation spans three parcels of land, two of which they acquired in 1996 at a price of $55,000 and a third totaling 126.777 acres, which was acquired as part of a larger purchase of 258.067 acres in December 1999 for approximately $325,000. In March 2000, the Boumas sought to expand their operations onto the remaining 129 acres of their parcel. Like the Kafkas, the Boumas made other investments necessary to institute their breeder operation, such as acquiring stock, License-related application costs, and fencing. According to the record, the Boumas never sold significant numbers of alternative livestock and their operation never generated a taxable profit.\n\u00b65 Jack and Myra Bridgewater (Bridgewaters) are the owners of the Phantom Bull Elk Ranch, LLC, located in Broadwater County. The Bridgewaters entered into the Game Farm business in 1992, and focused primarily on fee-shooting as the primary source of income, although they had also harvested and marketed antlers from their alternative livestock for the velvet market. They purchased the property on which their Game Farm operated in 1990 for approximately $415,000. Like the other appellants, the Bridgewaters invested in the infrastructure necessary to operate a Game Farm. Between 1993 and 2000, their Game Farm generated cash flow in excess of $1.1 million dollars, although the Bridgewaters never reported any profit on their tax returns.\n\u00b66 As is common among regulatory schemes, the requirements for maintaining a License under part 4 have changed somewhat throughout the years. However, on November 7,2000, part 4 underwent a radical change as a result of the passage of Initiative Measure No. 143 (1-143) by the citizens of Montana. 1-143 amended two very significant subsections of part 4. First, it resulted in the deletion of the existing language in \u00a7 87-4-412(2), MCA (1999), which permitted a License holder to transfer his License, and substituted the following: \u201cAn alternative livestock ranch license for a specific facility is not transferable.\u201d Section 87-4-412(2), MCA (2001). More significant was I-143\u2019s effect on \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA (1999), as indicated below. The pre-I-143 version of the statute is in normal type face, and the 1-143 addition to the statute is in bold.\n(2) The licensee may acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year as long as the licensee complies with the requirements of this part, except that the licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock, as defined in 87-2-101 or 87-4-406, or of any exotic hig game species for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.\nSection 87-4-414(2), MCA (2001) (emphasis added).\n\u00b67 Notably, the initiative did not revoke appellants\u2019 Licenses, nor did it result in the confiscation of their alternative livestock. Instead, 1-143 prohibited Game Farm operators from charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock. This was a significant departure from the previous scheme because some individuals were willing to expend significant amounts of money to shoot alternative livestock within the confines of a Game Farm. By prohibiting fee-shooting, 1-143 eliminated the most profitable use of the alternative livestock, and thus the profitability of Game Farms in Montana. At the same time, it did not eliminate all uses of the alternative livestock, as part 4 still permitted Game Farm owners to maintain their herds, harvest the animals for their meat or antlers, or sell them in out-of-state markets where fee-shooting was still legal.\n\u00b68 Aside from these small but extremely significant changes, the remainder of part 4 was unaltered by I-143\u2019s passage. All parties concede that the Game Farm industry was, and still is, a highly regulated industry. Both before and after the passage of 1-143, part 4 conditioned the ability of the licensee to breed, harvest, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock upon \u201ccompli[ance] with the requirement of this part ....\u201d Section 87-4-414(2), MCA. Part 4 also states that FWP reserves the right to revoke a License if the owner/operator \u201cfail[s] to operate an alternative livestock ranch according to the provisions of this part, rules adopted under this part, or stipulations of the alternative livestock ranch license....\u201d Section 87-4-427(l)(a), MCA. Part 4 outlines in detail the reporting, testing, and recording duties incumbent upon a Game Farm operator, details the steps the operator must take to receive a License, and gives FWP broad authority to inspect and quarantine alternative livestock if necessary. Part 4 also requires environmental assessments (EA) of any proposed operations. It places conditions upon the use and disposition of alternative livestock, and further provides that alternative livestock are the private property of the License holder \u201cfor which the licensee is responsible as provided by law.\u201d Section 87-4-414(1), MCA. Moreover, there are numerous implementing regulations governing the Game Farms which control virtually every aspect of the Game Farm industry. See Admin R. M. \u00a7\u00a7 32.4.101-1320 (2008).\n\u00b69 Because 1-143 eliminated the in-state market for fee-shooting and impaired the profitability of their Game Farm operations, the Kafkas challenged the validity of 1-143 in District Court. On April 5, 2002, the Kafkas filed suit against the State and FWP, challenging the lawfulness and constitutionality of 1-143 on a variety of grounds. On May 8, 2002, appellees-intervenors Sportsmen for 1-143 and Montana Wildlife Federation were permitted to intervene, opposing the Kafkas. On October 21, 2002, the District Court dismissed six of the seven counts alleged in the original complaint, none of which are on appeal before this Court. The remaining claim concerned whether the passage and implementation of 1-143 resulted in a taking of various property interests held by the Kafkas under Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The property interests allegedly taken by 1-143 included the Kafkas\u2019 animals, Licenses, real property, improvements, business, goodwill and livelihoods.\n\u00b610 As litigation before the District Court proceeded, the Bridgewaters and Boumas were granted leave to intervene and join the Kafkas in challenging I-143\u2019s constitutionality. On February 25,2003, the District Court bifurcated the legal proceedings and decided the takings claims would be determined separately. If the District Court found a taking had occurred, it would then submit the determination of damages to a jury.\n\u00b611 On May 19 and 20, 2004, the District Court held a bench trial on appellants\u2019 takings claims under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions. In the course of this trial, the District Court received voluminous testimony and evidence. On February 8,2005, the District Court issued a detailed and comprehensive order containing seventy-three findings of fact and fifty-one conclusions of law and ultimately denied appellants\u2019 takings claims. The District Court held that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a compensable taking of appellants\u2019 private property under the Montana or U.S. Constitutions. Judgment was rendered against appellants and they have timely appealed to this Court.\n\u00b612 Appellants challenge the District Court\u2019s order in several respects. We describe the rationale underlying the order in broad terms to convey a sense of the District Court\u2019s reasoning and analysis. First, we turn to the relevant portions of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact. The District Court found that all parties knew the Game Farm industry was highly regulated, existing only by virtue of legislative permission, and that the legislature reserved the ability to change the regulations governing Game Farms at all times. The District Court pointed to specific portions of the EA prepared for the Kafkas\u2019 operations in which FWP warned them of public unrest regarding Game Farms due to the threat posed by CWD and their negative impact on Montana\u2019s fair chase hunting tradition. For instance, in the EA prepared in 1996, FWP specifically noted that \u201c[t]here are many people who would like to see game farming prohibited in Montana. Some of these people belong to organizations that will probably continue their efforts to have legislation passed to eliminate game farming.\u201d In the EA for the Kafkas\u2019 second License, FWP noted much public concern on the negative effect that Game Farms have on Montana\u2019s hunting heritage and the sport of hunting in Montana. However, FWP also noted that game farms were legitimate, regulated activities, approved by the legislature, and that it had \u201cno authority to regulate game farms based solely on public sentiment.\u201d Although there was no evidence that the Boumas or Bridgewaters received these same warnings, the District Court found that they knew, or should have known, about the tentative status of Game Farms in Montana.\n\u00b613 The District Court also issued findings concerning the economic effect of 1-143 with respect to appellants\u2019 property interests. On the one hand, the District Court found appellants\u2019 real estate retained significant value in spite of 1-143 and that some of appellants\u2019 lands had appreciated in value since initially purchased. With respect to the Kafkas, the District Court found that the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of the land associated with their original breeder operation was as \u201ca small tract of range land, with a possible conversion to a rural home site with adjoining pasture.\u201d Its value for this use as of November 7, 2000, was $34,720. The second property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d was found to be as \u201crangeland with recreational influences, used for the production of livestock and a potential homesite,\u201d and its value as of November 7, 2000, was $336,000. Although the Kafkas argued that covenants in the title documents prevented such a use, the District Court was not persuaded by their evidence on this point. The District Court also took notice of the fact that the covenants in question had already been lifted by agreement entered into between the Kafkas and Hill County on March 29, 2004. Further, the District Court rejected expert testimony presented by the Kafkas that the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of their lands was as Game Farms, finding that their expert testimony failed to conform to the standards established under the uniform standards for professional appraisal practice.\n\u00b614 With respect to the Bridgewaters\u2019 property, the District Court similarly found that its \u201chighest and best use\u201d was as a \u201crecreational ranch,\u201d and that the value of the land, improvements, and fixtures was $945,000 as of November 7, 2000. This was an approximately 100% appreciation in the value of the land since initially purchased in 1990. The District Court observed that the Bridgewaters did not provide expert testimony regarding the value of the land and its fixtures, or its highest and best use, and that their expert specifically denied having appraised any of the Bridgewaters\u2019 tangible real or personal property.\n\u00b615 The District Court found the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of the Boumas\u2019 property to be for \u201cagricultural production with the potential for future development for industrial or rural use.\u201d Its valuation for these uses as of November 7, 2000, was $258,000. This represented the value of the two original lots, now worth $87,000, and the third lot worth $171,000. These figures also represented a notable appreciation in the value of the Boumas\u2019 lands. Further, the District Court observed that the Boumas, like the Bridgewaters, provided no testimony as to the value of the land, its fixtures, its highest and best use, nor did they provide an expert appraisal of their tangible real or personal property.\n\u00b616 The District Court did, however, find that appellants\u2019 alternative livestock suffered a substantial loss in value as a result of 1-143. As the District Court noted, before 1-143, the Kafkas could fetch $5,000 to $6,000 per head of alternative livestock by virtue of fee-shooting. After 1-143, each head of livestock was worth only between $1,700 and $1,800 in out-of-state markets. Although there was testimony of even greater devaluations of the livestock of the Boumas and Bridgewaters, the District Court did not refer to these in its order. See \u00b6 84.\n\u00b617 The District Court then issued findings suggesting that this particular economic impact could be mitigated. The District Court noted that there still remained out-of-state markets for alternative livestock, and that appellants could harvest the alternative livestock for their meat and antlers. For instance, the Bridgewaters had been able to sell a herd of 160 of their alternative livestock to an out-of-state concern for approximately $80,000. The District Court also noted that none of the appellants had indicated any taxable profit on their tax returns, thus implying that their businesses were not profitable to begin with.\n\u00b618 Ultimately, the District Court\u2019s findings suggest that the Kafkas suffered the greatest economic impact, the Bridgewaters somewhat less, while the Boumas suffered no direct economic impact at all. The District Court tempered these conclusions by observing that all appellants either knew, or should have known, that Game Farms were highly controversial in Montana and that they were obliged to comply with any changes in the governing laws. Further, the District Court found that 1-143 served a legitimate state interest, insofar as it promoted Montana\u2019s hunting heritage, protected wild game populations from the spread of disease and hybridization, and thus generally protected the sport of hunting in Montana.\n\u00b619 In its conclusions of law, the District Court examined each of appellants\u2019 property interests separately to determine if they had been taken by 1-143. The District Court began by considering whether appellants\u2019 Licenses and intangible business assets (i.e., good will and going-concern value) were compensable property interests under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29. After reviewing the pertinent authorities, the District Court concluded that the Licenses were not compensable property interests and therefore could not be \u201ctaken.\u201d With respect to appellants\u2019 intangible business assets, the District Court concluded they were not taken because such interests are not compensable in the regulatory taking context.\n\u00b620 The District Court acknowledged that the land, alternative livestock, and other physical assets were compensable property interests, but ultimately found that none of these compensable property interests were taken by I-143. The District Court rejected the argument that appellants had suffered a \u201ccategorical taking\u201d under Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992), because these items continued to retain economic value, even if greatly diminished; thus, the conditions necessary for applying the Lucas analysis were not satisfied.\n\u00b621 The District Court then went on to consider whether there was a taking under the factors-based analysis from Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978). On the one hand, the District Court failed to see any evidence of an economic impact on appellants\u2019 land and fixtures as a result of 1-143. In this regard, the District Court noted that appellants failed to provide any expert appraisals to demonstrate the impact of 1-143 on their real estate interests. However, the District Court did recognize a significant impact on appellants\u2019 alternative livestock. Overall, however, the District Court concluded that any reasonable investment-backed expectations appellants may have had regarding their Game Farms had to be tempered against the reality that they were operating in a highly regulated, controversial field, where the State was free to change the regulatory environment. In short, appellants should have reasonably anticipated that something like 1-143 was on the horizon. Additionally, the District Court found that the character of the governmental action embodied in 1-143 was a valid exercise of the police power of the State and substantially advanced a number of legitimate state interests. Accordingly, the State had no constitutional duty to compensate appellants for the effects of 1-143, no matter how greatly it impaired the profitability of appellants\u2019 businesses.\n\u00b622 Appellants argue on appeal that several of the District Court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. The Kafkas, for instance, argue that the District Court improperly relied on tax return information to conclude that their businesses suffered no significant economic impact as a result of 1-143. Additionally, they argue that the evidence before the District Court showed that there was no viable out-of-state market for their alternative livestock or their by-products, and that after 1-143 they could only sell these animals at a loss. They also argue the District Court improperly relied upon on the various \u201chighest and best use\u201d appraisals for their parcels of land provided by the State\u2019s experts. They further dispute the finding that they should have known that the Montana voters might approve and pass a measure like 1-143. The Boumas and Bridgewaters join in these arguments, adding further criticisms of the appraisal methods upon with the District Court based its findings.\n\u00b623 In addition to challenging some of the District Court\u2019s factual findings, appellants fault the District Court for concluding that their Licenses and intangible business assets were not compensable property interests. Appellants maintain that the District Court should have concluded these interests were compensable and then analyzed them under the appropriate takings analysis. Additionally, appellants argue that the District Court erred in its takings analysis of its interests in the land and alternative livestock with respect to each of the Penn Central factors. They argue that the District Court failed to appreciate the economic impact 1-143 had on their businesses and property, relying too much on the fact that appellants failed to report a taxable profit on their tax returns. They also assert that their investment-backed expectations were reasonable, in spite of the fact that they were participating in a highly regulated field of business. Further, they fault the District Court for placing too much emphasis on whether 1-143 was a legitimate exercise of the State\u2019s police power, and overlooking the fact that 1-143 unfairly forces appellants to bear the economic burden associated with the elimination of Game Farms in Montana.\n\u00b624 Appellants urge us to conclude that the District Court erred, and that 1-143 effected an unconstitutional taking of their Licenses and tangible and intangible business assets. The State and intervenors maintain the District Court\u2019s order was correct in its particulars and urge us to affirm.\nISSUES\n\u00b625 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:\n\u00b626 Issue One: Did the District Court err in concluding that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a taking of appellants\u2019 Licenses and the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution?\n\u00b627 Issue Two: Did the District Court err in concluding that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a taking of appellants\u2019 real and tangible personal property under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b628 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. State v. Fyant, 2004 MT 298, \u00b6 7, 323 Mont. 408, \u00b6 7, 104 P.3d 434, \u00b6 7. We review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). We use a three-part test to determine if a finding is clearly erroneous. Interstate Prod. Credit Assn. v. DeSaye, 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287 (1991). First, we examine the record to determine if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. DeSaye, 250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287. Second, we consider whether the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence. DeSaye, 250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287. Third, if both of these tests are satisfied, we may still conclude that \u201c[a] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d DeSaye, 250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287 (quotation omitted).\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b629 Issue One: Did the District Court err in concluding that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a taking of appellants\u2019 Licenses and the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution?\n\u00b630 The Takings Clause of the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part that private property shall not \u201cbe taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution states that \u201c[p]rivate property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the owner.\u201d Although the plain language of these provisions differ insofar as Section 29 refers to both \u201ctaking\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d as a basis for just compensation, we have generally looked to federal case law for guidance when considering a takings claim brought under Article II, Section 29. Western Energy Co. v. Genie Land Co., 227 Mont. 74, 77-78, 737 P.2d 478, 480-83 (1987); Germann v. Stephens, 2006 MT 130, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 332 Mont. 303, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 137 P.3d 545, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. This approach is consistent with that of other jurisdictions which have similar or identical language in their state constitutions. E.g., San Remo Hotel L.P. v. City and Co. of San Francisco, 41 P.3d 87, 100-101 (Cal. 2002) (citations and quotations omitted, alterations in original) (\u201cBy virtue of including \u2018damageff to property as well as its \u2018tak[ing],\u2019 the California clause protects a somewhat broader range of property values than does the corresponding federal provision. But aside from that difference ... we appear to have construed the clauses congruently.\u201d).\n\u00b631 In its order, the District Court concluded that appellants had waived any argument they may have had that Article II, Section 29 provides greater protection in the regulatory taking context than the Fifth Amendment. In conclusion of law No. 3, the District Court held that \u201cPlaintiffs have conceded that analysis under the Montana Constitution does not differ from that under the Fifth Amendment....\u201d In their briefing before this Court, appellants have not mounted a challenge to this conclusion. Moreover, appellants rely almost exclusively on federal case law to challenge the District Court\u2019s application of the Penn Central factors. Because the parties and the District Court have adhered to our previous approach of looking towards federal jurisprudence when considering takings claims under Montana law, we will continue to follow that approach here.\n\u00b632 \u201cA takings claim requires a two-step analysis in which a court first determines whether a plaintiff possesses a cognizable property interest in the subject of the alleged taking. The question of whether plaintiffs owned a compensable property interest presents a question of law based on factual underpinnings.\u201d Mohlen v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 656, 660 (Fed. Cl. 2006) (quotation omitted). After a compensable property interest has been established \u201cthe court decides if the governmental action at issue constituted a taking of that property.\u201d Mohlen, 74 Fed. Cl. at 661. As we have stated in a similar context, \u201c[u]nder Montana law, the threshold question of whether one has a protected property interest must... be answered in the affirmative before the question of whether one was deprived of that interest may be submitted to the trier of fact.\u201d Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, 2005 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 306, \u00b6 26, 114 P.3d 1009, \u00b6 26 (quotation and alterations omitted, ellipsis in original); accord Maritrans, Inc. v. United States, 342 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\u00b633 Property interests themselves are not defined by the Takings Clause, or for that matter by Article II, Section 29; \u201c[rjather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201dRuckleshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1001, 104 S. Ct. 2862, 2872 (1984) (quotation omitted); accord Germann, \u00b6 27. \u201cThese \u2018background principles\u2019 and \u2018rules and understandings\u2019 focus on the nature of the citizen\u2019s relationship to the alleged property, such as whether the citizen had the rights to exclude, use, transfer, or dispose of the property.\u201d Members of the Peanut Quota Holders Assn. Inc. v. United States, 421 F.3d 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2005), cert. denied 126 S. Ct. 2967 (2006).\n\u00b634 The District Court found that the Licenses were not compensable property interests. The gist of the District Court\u2019s reasoning was that the Licenses are more akin to privileges, and not vested property interests which could be subject to a taking. The District Court noted that this view was generally consistent with prevailing authority. Moreover, the District Court found no case law for the proposition that a taking of a license occurs when a new regulatory requirement, or in this case a regulatory prohibition, \u201cma[kes] the licensed business less profitable than it had been prior to the new regulations.\u201d Further, the District Court observed that \u201c[w]hen state law creates the privilege of holding a license to engage in a heavily regulated business like game farming is in Montana, it need not pay compensation when it changes the conditions under which that privilege may be exercised.\u201d Simply put, appellants possess no common law property right to the Licenses, and the State retained the power at all times to revoke or changes those Licenses if it chose to do so.\n\u00b635 Similarly, the District Court found that appellants\u2019 intangible business assets (i.e., the goodwill and going-concern value oftheir Game Farms) were not compensable property interests in the regulatory takings context. The District Court, citing to Andrus v. Allard, 44 U.S. 51, 100 S. Ct. 318 (1979), among others, noted precedent weighed heavily against the notion that loss of future profits, without more, provided a basis for a takings claim. The District Court concluded that appellants cited no case law \u201cfor the proposition that loss of future business opportunity is a compensable property interest under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Moreover, the District Court noted that the ability to operate a Game Farm was not a common law right, and that because this ability was wholly dependent upon legislative permission, the State was not required to pay compensation for any business loss resulting from 1-143.\n\u00b636 Appellants\u2019 challenge these conclusions. Generally speaking, appellants argue that Licenses, goodwill, and going-concern value are property interests recognized under Montana law. As such, they argue it was incorrect for the District Court to simply conclude that they could not be taken as a result of the regulatory change occasioned by 1-143. Appellants urge us to reverse the District Court on this point, find these interests were compensable, and then correctly apply the Penn Central or Lucas takings analysis.\n\u00b637 In cases where there is a \u201cmix\u201d of property interests, it is appropriate, if warranted under the circumstances, to consider those interests separately in a takings analysis. See Conti v. United States, 291 F.3d 1334, 1340-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cert. denied 537 U.S. 1112 (2003); Maritrans, 342 F.3d at 1352-53. That was the approach applied by the District Court and we will follow it here. Moreover, it is critical to bear in mind throughout our discussion that appellants bear the burden of proving a taking has occurred. Mohlen, 74 Fed. Cl. at 660.\nA. Licenses as Compensable Property Interests\n\u00b638 Generally speaking, a license is simply a right or privilege granted by a sovereign authority to engage in certain activity. 53 C. J.S. Licenses \u00a7 2, 441-42 (West 2005); Members, 421 F.3d at 1333 (stating that a fishing license \u201cis merely a representation by the government that it will not interfere with the licensee\u2019s efforts to catch fish.\u201d). \u201cA license is a right granted by some competent authority to do an act which, without such license, would be illegal.\u201d Beard v. City of Atlanta, 86 S.E.2d 672, 676 (Ga. App. 1955). In a similar context, we have stated that \u201c[a] license is a grant by a government authority or agency of the right to engage in conduct that would be improper without such a grant. The conferment of a license... is merely a privilege...\u201d Wallace v. Mont. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, 269 Mont. 364, 368, 889 P.2d 817, 820 (1995) (quotation omitted, ellipsis in original).\n\u00b639 At the same time, courts have recognized that some licenses may contain property interests that go beyond their status as a \u201cmere privilege.\u201d \u201c[A] license may implicate property interests. A license holder, for example, may acquire a property right protected by the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause. A professional license may be property for the purposes of equitable distribution. A license may be transferrable and may be worth a substantial sum to its holder.\u201d United States v. Berg, 710 F. Supp. 434, 437 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) (citations and footnote omitted). In State v. Pyette, 2007 MT 119, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232, for instance, we observed that a state-issued driver\u2019s license constitutes a property interest for purposes of due process. Pyette, \u00b6 13. Similarly, in United States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284 (11th Cir. 1999), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that a medical license was considered \u201cproperty\u201d for the purposes of a federal drug forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853, in reliance upon Georgia case law to the effect that a state-issued license to practice medicine constituted a valuable property right. Dicter, 198 F.3d at 1290; See also Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262 n. 8, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 1017 n. 8 (1970) (discussing increasing tendency in modern society to recognize property rights in government-conferred entitlements and licenses).\n\u00b640 However, as the District Court recognized, appellants\u2019 arguments generally fail to appreciate the critical distinction between what might be considered property for purposes of due process, and what types of interests are considered compensable under the Fifth Amendment or Article II, Section 29. Appellants have cited cases such as Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976) and Wedges / Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56 (9th Cir. 1994) which demonstrate that licenses can be property for purposes of due process. But none of these cases are helpful or relevant in this context. \u201cCare ... must be exercised not to analogize what is \u2018property\u2019 for purposes of the Takings Clause and what might be viewed as a \u2018property interest\u2019 under the Due Process Clause, as the two concepts are dissimilar.\u201d Arctic King Fisheries, Inc. v. United States, 59 Fed. Cl. 360, 372 n. 27 (Fed. Cl. 2004). Without belaboring the point, suffice it to say that reliance on due process cases to prove a particular property interest is compensable for purposes of a takings analysis is simply misplaced. See Kizas v. Webster, 707 F.2d 524, 534-40 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (demonstrating that property interests for purposes of due process are not equivalent to compensable interests under the Takings Clause).\n\u00b641 Courts which have directly considered the question at bar have taken a dim view of the notion that government-issued licenses are compensable property interests. See United States v. Fuller, 409 U.S. 488, 93 S. Ct. 801 (1973) (grazing permit not a compensable property interest); accord Stevens Co. v. United States Dept. of Interior, 507 F. Supp. 2d 1127 (E.D. Wash. 2007); Conti, 291 F.3d at 1342 (no compensable property interest in a government-issued fishing license); accord Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., L.P. v. United States, 379 F.3d 1363, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2004), cert. denied 545 U.S. 1139 (2005); accord Arctic King, 59 Fed. Cl. at 371; Hawkeye Commodity Promotions, Inc. v. Vilsack, 486 F.3d 430, 439-40 (8th Cir. 2007) (no compensable property interest in a state-issued license to operate lottery machines). As noted by the District Court, appellants presented no authority under takings jurisprudence to counter this view.\n\u00b642 Nevertheless, compensable property interests can exist in government-issued licenses or permits if they are free from \u201cexpress statutory language precluding the formation of a property right in combination with the presence of the right to transfer and the right to exclude.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1331. In Members, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals considered a takings claim brought by members of the Peanut Quota Holders Association, Inc. (Members). The Members had been long-time participants in a government-established program entitling them to receive quotas to grow specific quantities of peanuts. Under the program, the Members were able to lease or sell their quotas to other farmers. One of the significant benefits the Members enjoyed as a result of this arrangement was the ability to secure favorable loan rates.\n\u00b643 The Members were initially peanut farmers, but over time they ceased to grow peanuts while retaining their right to sell and lease their peanut quotas. In 2002, Congress changed the peanut quota program, allowing only individuals who actually farmed peanuts to participate. Because the Members lost their ability to receive quotas, they lost the favorable loan rates they had formerly secured. The Members argued that the change in the program, which prevented them from participating in it, constituted a taking of these favorable loan rates. Members, 421 F.3d at 1325.\n\u00b644 The primary issue before the Court of Appeals was whether the quotas were compensable property interests under the Fifth Amendment. To address this question, the Court of Appeals turned to the seminal cases in this area for guidance, including Fuller, Conti, Am. Pelagic, and. Mitchell Arms, Inc. v. United States, 7 F.3d 212 (Fed. Cir. 1993), cert. denied 511 U.S. 1106 (1994). First, the Court noted that \u201c[t]he right to transfer is a traditional hallmark of property\u201d and that the quotas were indeed transferable. Members, 421 F.3d at 1332. Then the Court considered whether the quotas gave the Members the \u201cright to exclude,\u201d observing that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has recently recognized that the right to exclude is \u2018perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests.\u2019 \u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1333 (quoting Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2082 (2005)). The Court observed a critical distinction between licenses generally and the quotas before it. The quotas were \u201cconsiderably more concrete\u201d than, for instance, a license to fish because such a license \u201cis merely a representation by the government that it will not interfere with the licensee\u2019s efforts to catch fish.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1333. In other words,\n[s]o long as the government retains the discretion to determine the total number of licenses issued, the number of market entrants is indeterminate. Such a license is by its very nature not exclusive. Neither the fisherman nor the firearms salesman can exclude later licensees from entering the market, increasing competition, and thereby diminishing the value of his license.\nMembers, 421 F.3d at 1334.\n\u00b645 The peanut quotas conferred the \u201cright to exclude\u201d because the quotas themselves \u201crepresented a right to plant and produce a certain amount of peanuts at a certain price in specific crop years.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1334. In other words, the quota program conferred upon \u201cthe peanut quota holders... an excludable interest, because the peanut quota program isolated their particular interest from competition.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1334. Ultimately, in spite of the fact that the quotas were compensable property interests, the Court of Appeals found that the government was under no constitutional duty to compensate the Members because neither the statute, nor the surrounding circumstances, indicated that the quotas were irrevocable, and the government always maintained \u201cits right to withdraw those benefits or qualify them as it chooses.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1335.\n\u00b646 As stated in Members, to qualify as compensable property interests, the Licenses must be transferable, exclusive, and free of any \u201cexpress statutory language precluding the formation of a property right ....\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1331. We address each of these requirements in turn, as they apply to the Licenses before us.\n\u00b647 With respect to whether the Licenses were transferrable, we note that \u00a7 87-4-412(2), MCA (1999), gave the licensee the right to transfer the Licenses subject to FWP approval. According to the statute, FWP did not have broad discretion to deny the transfer assuming the transferee complied with the statutory requirements of part 4. Section 87-4-412(2), MCA (1999). Before the passage of 1-143, the Licenses were transferable.\n\u00b648 It is arguably a closer question as to whether the Licenses were free of any express statutory language that would prohibit the formation of a compensable property interest in the License itself. Neither part 4 nor the Licenses themselves contain the type of express \u201cdisclaimer\u201d language discussed in cases like Fuller, Conti, or Am. Pelagic. See Fuller, 409 U.S. at 489, 93 S. Ct. at 803 (quoting 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315b); Conti, 291 F.3d at 1341-42 (citing 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(d)(3)(D), (d)(2)(A)); Am. Pelagic, 379 F.3d at 1374 (citing 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 904.301(a)). In all of those cases, there was language in the enabling regulations or statutes which expressly disclaimed that the licenses or permits themselves created any compensable property interests.\n\u00b649 However, part 4 does put the holder on notice that continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations is required for maintenance of the License. See \u00b6 8. Both versions of part 4 state that the licensee may breed, harvest, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock, so long as she \u201ccomplies with the requirement of this part.\u201d Both versions of part 4 specifically state that FWP may revoke the Licenses if the operator fails \u201cto operate an alternative livestock ranch according to the provisions of this part, rules adopted under this part, or stipulations of the alternative livestock ranch license.\u201d Section 87-4-427(l)(a), MCA. Thus, nothing in part 4 limits the ability or discretion of FWP or the State to make changes to the statute. Additionally, the Licenses issued to all appellants stated that they were subject to the \u201cgeneral requirements of the game farm statutes and rules for Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks and the Montana Department of Livestock....\u201d \u00b650 More importantly, nothing in the Licenses or part 4 expressly revokes the ability of the State to alter those Licenses via duly enacted statutory amendments or changes. In this regard, we note the operation of\u00a7 1-2-110, MCA, entitled \u201cAll statutes subject to repeal,\u201d which states: \u201cAny statute may be repealed at any time except when it is otherwise provided therein. Persons acting under any statute are deemed to have acted in contemplation of this power of repeal.\u201d Section 1-2-110, MCA. As the District Court correctly held, the ability to operate a Game Farm is not a common law right incident to the ownership of real property, and is legal only by virtue of legislative enactment. \u201cThat the ownership of wild animals is in the state, held by it in its sovereign capacity for the use and benefit of the people generally, and that neither such animals nor parts thereof are subject to private ownership except in so far as the state may choose to make them so, are principles now too firmly established to be open to controversy.\u201d Rosenfeld v. Jakways, 67 Mont. 558, 562, 216 P. 776, 777 (1923). Assuming any statutory amendment is lawful, there is no legal authority which would restrict the State from making amendments to part 4 in the interests of further regulating the Game Farm industry. As the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals stated in Members,\n[t]he government is free to create programs that convey benefits in the form of property, but, unless the statute itself or surrounding circumstances indicate that such conveyances are intended to be irrevocable, the government does not forfeit its right to withdraw those benefits or qualify them as it chooses.\nMembers, 421 F.3d at 1335.\n\u00b651 However, even assuming arguendo it is a closer question as to whether part 4 and the Licenses are actually free of express language prohibiting the formation of a compensable property interest, we do not need to resolve that question to conclude the Licenses are not compensable property interests, because they undoubtedly lack the most significant of all the indicia discussed in Members: the right to exclude. \u201cIn the bundle of rights we call property, one of the most valued is the right to sole and exclusive possession-the right to exclude strangers, or for that matter friends, but especially the Government.\u201d Hendler v. United States, 952 F.2d 1364, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1991).\n\u00b652 Nothing in the language of the Licenses or either version of part 4 gives the License holders the right to exclude others from the Game Farm industry. There was no limit to the number of Licenses which could be issued by FWP, and so the appellants were never given the \u201cright to exclude\u201d by virtue of their Licenses. The License holders in this case received a representation by the State that it would not interfere with their efforts to operate Game Farms, so long as they complied with the requirements of part 4. However, none were assured of freedom from competition, and none of the Licenses conferred upon appellants a discrete segment of the Game Farm industry in Montana.\n\u00b653 Moreover, as is conceded by all parties in this case, the Game Farm industry was highly regulated due to concerns over the damaging impact of CWD. See \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8. As the Federal Circuit noted in Members, \u201cwhen a citizen voluntarily enters into a market subject to pervasive government control, he cannot be said to possess the right to exclude.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1331. While the appellants certainly had the right to exclude others from fee-shooting on their property, that right was not due to the Licenses, but due to their inherent rights in the real property on which those operations were conducted. See Presley v. City of Charlottesville, 464 F.3d 480, 492 n. 2 (4th Cir. 2006) (stating that \u201cperhaps the most important aspect of real property ownership [is] the right to exclude others from one\u2019s property.\u201d) (citing Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80, 100 S. Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979)).\n\u00b654 Accordingly, because the Licenses did not meet the three required criteria for compensability under Members, we conclude the District Court did not err when it held the Licenses were not compensable property interests under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, or Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution.\nB. Appellants\u2019 Intangible Business Assets\n\u00b655 We turn now to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that 1-143 did not take appellants\u2019 intangible business assets. We start with the proposition that intangible assets are statutorily recognized forms of property in Montana, and possess the indicia of property which the Licenses do not. See Section 70-1-104(4), MCA; In re Marriage of Hull, 219 Mont. 480, 484-85, 712 P.2d 1317, 1320-21 (1986). However, this does not necessarily mean that such intangibles can be \u201ctaken\u201d in the regulatory context. In its order, the District Court stated that \u201c[a]n intangible interest in a business has never been held to be a proper subject of a regulatory taking claim.\u201d This is true. While goodwill and going-concern value can be taken as a result of government condemnation, appellants point to no cases where a taking of going-concern or goodwill has been found in the regulatory takings context.\n\u00b656 In Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S. Ct. 1434 (1949), the Supreme Court established that, under limited circumstances, intangible assets like going-concern value can be taken in a manner requiring just compensation be paid to the owner. There, the Supreme Court held that when the government temporarily condemned a laundry plant, it was required to compensate plaintiffs for the going-concern value of trade routes. Kimball, 338 U.S. at 11-16, 69 S. Ct. at 1440-43. However, since Kimball was decided, courts have found these types of takings only in those rare circumstances where the government actually intends to take over the claimant\u2019s business and thereby appropriate the goodwill and going-concern value for its own use. Thus, the federal district court for the Eastern District of Michigan held no compensation was due for loss of going-concern value to a claimant\u2019s trucking business as a result of a government condemnation of land, because the claimant did not demonstrate that the government condemned the land with the intent of operating a similar business. United States v. Five Parcels, 1.11195 Acres of Land, More or Less, Situated in the City of Detroit, Wayne County, State of Michigan, 765 F. Supp. 1283, 1286 (E.D. Mich. 1991). The federal district court for the Western District of Michigan stated the general approach to these questions as follows:\nThe Court concludes that where, as in this case, 1) the government intends to construct facilities in substitution for an existing business; 2) the new business is operated under the government\u2019s pervasive regulation; 3) the government creates a monopoly situation and realizes a pecuniary interest by doing so, the government\u2019s activity is tantamount to the operation of the ongoing concern which, in turn, comprises a business taking.\nUnited States v. 0.88 Acres of Land, 670 F. Supp 210, 213 (W.D. Mich. 1987).\n\u00b657 As the jurisprudence in this area makes plain, taking of goodwill or going-concern value differs markedly from other types of taking. This is likely because what the claimant alleges has been \u201ctaken\u201d is an expectation of future profitability. As the United States Supreme Court stated in Andrus, a \u201closs of future profits-unaccompanied by any physical property restriction-provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim. Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform.\u201d Andrus, 444 U.S. at 66, 100 S. Ct. at 327. In cases such as Kimball, where there is an actual physical occupation of land by the government, fundamental property rights are implicated; thus, if the going-concern value is based upon a right or ability to exclusive use of the property which the government is occupying, it makes sense to provide compensation for the value lost. Turning to this case, it is important to note that appellants cite no authority for the proposition that compensation of the loss of their intangible assets should be paid under their regulatory takings claims. Any citation to Kimball is unavailing for the simple reason that Kimball involved actual physical occupation of land-a critical fact which is absent in this case.\n\u00b658 An expectation of profitability in a highly regulated field of business, where a license or permit is required for participation, is virtually never, in and of itself, considered a compensable property interest. In Mitchell Arms, for instance, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals found that an arms dealer had no cognizable property interest in an expectation of selling assault rifles in domestic commerce, because that right was totally dependent upon the government\u2019s granting him a license to sell those weapons. Mitchell Arms, 7 F.3d at 217. Thus, when the government withdrew the permit, the arms dealer had no basis upon which to assert a takings claim because all the government \u201c \u2018took\u2019 ... [was] the ability to realize an expectation in the ultimate market disposition of the rifles. This \u2018collateral interest\u2019 incident to [the] ownership of the rifles is not property protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Mitchell Arms, 7 F.3d at 217; See United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 378, 65 S. Ct. 357, 360 (1945) (\u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment concerns itself solely with the \u2018property,\u2019 i.e., with the owner\u2019s relation as such to the physical thing and not with other collateral interests which may be incident to his ownership.\u201d).\n\u00b659 Similarly, in Allied-General Nuclear Servs. v. United States, 839 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals found that a private company which had been induced by the federal government to invest $200 million dollars into the development of a nuclear power plant, had no takings claim when the government suddenly changed its mind and decided that the construction of the plant would represent a danger to national security. Allied-General, 839 F.2d at 1576-78. The Court of Appeals noted that the licensing power of the government when \u201cuse[d] for purposes within the object of the power reserved will be valid even if detrimental to the owner\u2019s full utilization of the property.\u201d Allied-General, 839 F.2d at 1577 (citing Nollan v. California Coastal Commn., 483 U.S. 825, 832-35, 107 S. Ct. 3141, 3146-47 (1987)). The appeals court rejected the notion that excessive inducement from the government to enter into this area and expend significant amounts of money should alter its conclusion, finding that in the absence of a direct contract between the government and the private corporation, the expectation of profiting in such a highly regulated and risky field could not by itself be considered a compensable property interest. Allied-General, 839 F.2d at 1577-78. More recently, in Hawkeye Commodity, the Eighth Circuit found that a company had no property interest in a right to continued operation in the state-regulated lottery business. Hawkeye Commodity, 486 F.3d at 439-40. Thus, when the state of Iowa enacted legislation which prohibited a particular type of lottery game, the company, which had been previously engaged in that type of business, had no basis for a takings claim. Hawkeye Commodity, 486 F.3d at 440.\n\u00b660 Similarly, in Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, 75 Fed. Cl. 642 (Fed. Cl. 2007), the Federal Claims Court found no compensable property interest when the government federalized airport screening in 2001 under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), and allegedly \u201ctook\u201d the company\u2019s entire screening business, including its \u201ccontracts, goodwill and going concern value.\u201d Huntleigh, 75 Fed. Cl. at 645. The Claims Court concluded it was immaterial whether the private company could have anticipated the regulatory changes, because the federal government retained the ability at all times to make those regulatory changes. Huntleigh, 75 Fed. Cl. at 646. In Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, 525 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (Huntleigh II)-a case cited, but not discussed or analyzed by the Dissent at \u00b6\u00b6 167,168, 201-the Federal Court of Appeals affirmed the claims court decision in Huntleigh. In affirming the lower court, the court noted that Huntleigh\u2019s argument was not whether the government actually \u201ctook\u201d its screening contracts-because there was no physical condemnation or occupation by the ATSA-but rather whether the regulatory change embodied in the federalization of airport screening under the ATSA \u201crendered the contracts and the going concern value and goodwill associated with Huntleigh\u2019s security screening business worthless.\u201d Huntleigh II, 525 F.3d at 1379. When Congress federalized airport screening under the ATSA \u201cit effectively eliminated the market for [Huntleigh\u2019s services], given that it concentrated all screening functions in the federal government. Thus ... Huntleigh and the other airlines with which it had contracts treated their contracts as terminated upon the government\u2019s full assumption of screening functions at airports, resulting in considerable loss of business to Huntleigh.\u201d Huntleigh II, 525 F.3d at 1375.\n\u00b661 However, while the ATSA frustrated Huntleigh\u2019s business expectations, it did not take any of Huntleigh\u2019s property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Huntleigh II, 525 F.3d at 1380-82. Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeals distinguished the application of Kimball as follows:\nOur reasoning applies to all property interests possessed by Huntleigh, including its contracts and any going concern value or goodwill associated with its security screening business. Thus, the authority of Kimball Laundry does not alter our holding. Though going concern value and goodwill are indeed compensable property interests, Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 11, 69 S.Ct. 1434, those property interests, like Huntleigh\u2019s contracts, were merely \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the government\u2019s enactment of ATSA. They were not taken. Moreover, going concern value is a property interest that has been held to be compensable in the context of a temporary, but not a permanent, taking.\nHuntleigh II, 525 F.3d at 1382 n. 3.\n\u00b662 Huntleigh\u2019s unsuccessful argument is nearly identical to that advanced by the appellants. It is indisputable that in the enactment and enforcement of 1-143, the State has not \u201cappropriated for its own use any property owned by [the appellants].\u201d Huntleigh II, 525 F.3d at 1381. Thus, 1-143 did not physically appropriate or \u201ctake\u201d any of the appellants\u2019 property, although it did eliminate the in-state market for fee-shooting and had a significant impact upon the value of their businesses.\n\u00b663 In this case, appellants have alleged a taking of their intangible business assets because 1-143 eliminated the in-state market for fee-shooting. In other words, 1-143 has \u201ctaken\u201d appellants\u2019 ability to profit from fee-shooting. Yet, as is clear from the foregoing authorities, these interests are not compensable in this case under the Fifth Amendment or Article II, \u00a7 29 of the Montana Constitution because there has been no physical condemnation or occupation of appellants\u2019 property by the State. We disagree with appellants\u2019 assertions that the District Court was splitting hairs by not considering the economic impact on the intangible aspects of their businesses and licenses. The District Court correctly recognized that takings claims for goodwill and going-concern value have never been recognized in the regulatory taking context. The unique circumstances required to assert a taking of these intangible assets, namely a physical condemnation of some sort by the State, are not present in this case.\n\u00b664 Accordingly, the District Court did not err when it found that appellants were not entitled to compensation for damage to the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses as a result of 1-143.\n\u00b665 Issue Two: Did the District Court err in concluding that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a taking of appellants\u2019 real and tangible personal property under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution ? \u00b666 We now address appellants\u2019 contention that 1-143 effected a regulatory taking of their real and personal property-i.e., their land and attached fixtures, and their livestock. There is no question that a person has a compensable property interest arising out of the ownership of such real and personal property.\n\u00b667 Once a claimant establishes a compensable property interest, \u201cthe court must then determine whether a part or a whole of that interest has been appropriated by the government for the benefit of the public.\u201d Members, 421 F.3d at 1330. Initially, courts assumed that \u201cthe Takings Clause reached only a direct appropriation of property, or the functional equivalent of a practical ouster of [the owner\u2019s] possession.\u201d Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1014, 112 S. Ct. at 2892 (citations and quotations omitted, alterations in original). In the modern world, it is well-established that state action or regulation may go \u201ctoo far,\u201d and constitute a taking, in the absence of physical invasion or outright appropriation. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 414-15, 43 S. Ct. 158, 159-60 (1922). These so-called \u201cregulatory takings\u201d fall into one of two categories.\nFirst, where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property-however minor-it must provide just compensation. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking). A second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of \u201call economically beneficial us[e]\u201d of her property. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (emphasis in original).\nLingle, 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S. Ct. at 2081.\n\u00b668 In other words, aside from an outright physical invasion, a \u201ccategorical taking\u201d is deemed to have occurred when a regulation or state action forces an owner \u201c \u2018to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle ....\u2019 \u201d Seven Up Pete, \u00b6 21 (quoting Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1019, 112 S. Ct. at 2895). Thus, when land or other interests retain economic value, no categorical taking has occurred. Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 330-32, 122 S. Ct. 1465, 1483-84 (2002).\n\u00b669 However, even when a compensable property interest still retains economic value, just compensation may be required if \u201c \u2018justice and fairness\u2019 require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124,98 S. Ct. at 2659. Determining when such compensation is required is essentially an \u201cad hoc, factual inquiry\u201d based on the circumstances of each case. In Penn Central, the Supreme Court suggested that courts examine the following factors in the course of making this determination: (1) the character of the governmental action; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant. Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659. While courts may consider all three factors, in some cases one or more are dispositive. E.g., Ruckleshaus, 467 U.S. at 1005-06, 104 S. Ct. at 2874 (finding the reasonable investment-backed expectation prong dispositive under Penn Central analysis).\n\u00b670 In jurisprudence under Penn Central, courts have fleshed out the practical meaning of each of these factors. In analysis of the first factor, the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action,\u201d the inquiry focuses primarily on \u201cwhether the [governmental action] amounts to a physical invasion or instead merely affects property interests through \u2018some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good ....\u2019 \u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082 (quoting Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124). In Lingle, the United States Supreme Court clarified that under the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d prong of the Penn Central regulatory takings analysis, whether a challenged regulation \u201csubstantially advances\u201d a legitimate state interest \u201cis not a valid method of identifying regulatory takings for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 545, 125 S. Ct. at 2085. While the Supreme Court did not state with perfect clarity how the character of the governmental action is to be measured, it did state that\n[T]he \u201csubstantially advances\u201d inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights. Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners. In consequence, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.\nLingle, 544 U.S. at 542, 125 S. Ct. at 2084.\n\u00b671 The rejection of the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d formula with respect to the character of the governmental action prong was simply meant to ensure that courts correctly quantify the effect of the regulation in terms of actual property rights and the magnitude of the infringement on those rights. Physical occupations, however slight, automatically require some form of compensation \u201cbecause of the unique burden they impose: A permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails, eviscerates the owner\u2019s right to exclude others from entering and using her property-perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082. Similarly, the \u201ccomplete elimination of a property\u2019s value\u201d may give rise to a \u201ccategorical\u201d or total regulatory takings. Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539-40, 125 S. Ct. at 2082. Regulatory takings, by contrast, turn more on the magnitude of the economic impact and \u201cthe degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 540, 125 S. Ct. at 2082. Thus, under the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d prong courts should inquire concerning the magnitude or character of the burden imposed by the regulation, and determine whether it is functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property.\n\u00b672 Under the \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations\u201d factor, the claimant\u2019s expectation must be \u201creasonable ... [and] must be more than a unilateral expectation or an abstract need \"Ruckleshaus, 467 U.S. at 1005-06, 104 S. Ct. at 2874 (quotation omitted). This factor limits takings claims to those who can \u201cdemonstrate that they bought their property in reliance on a state of affairs that did not include the challenged regulatory regime.\u201d Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v. United States, 373 F.3d 1177, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cThis factor also incorporates an objective test-to support a claim for a regulatory taking, an investment-backed expectation must be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d Cienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Under the third criteria, \u201ceconomic impact,\u201d the court measures the impact of the regulatory change by considering \u201cthe change in the fair market value of the subject property caused by the regulatory imposition-in other words, the court must \u2018compare the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property.\u2019 \u201d Arctic King, 59 Fed. Cl. at 374 (quoting Keystone, 480 U.S. at 497, 107 S. Ct. at 1248). In assessing this factor, the court will look at the magnitude of the impact on the \u201cparcel as a whole.\u201d Rose Acre Farms, 373 F.3d at 1185 (citing Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31, 98 S. Ct. at 2662).\n\u00b673 With respect to the land, the District Court found there was no categorical taking under Lucas because the evidence showed those lands still retained substantial economic value; indeed, some of those lands even appreciated. The District Court also rejected appellants\u2019 arguments that they were entitled to just compensation for these interests under the Penn Central analysis. Under the \u201ceconomic impact\u201d factor, the District Court concluded that appellants did not show that their real estate interests suffered any significant economic impact as a result of 1-143, and further that they failed to demonstrate any change in the fair market value of their land as a result of 1-143. See \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n\u00b674 The District Court did recognize a substantial economic impact on appellants\u2019 alternative livestock; however, it concluded that the economic impact was not severe, in part because none of the appellants reported taxable profit on their tax returns for the years their Game Farms were in operation. Under the \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations\u201d factor, the District Court acknowledged that appellants\u2019 had significant expectations, but noted \u201ctheir subjective expectation of profit must be legally tempered by the objective reality that they were engaged in a highly regulated and speculative new industry.\u201d The District Court concluded all appellants knew the Game Farm industry was highly regulated, that they were allowed to participate in the business because the privilege was extended by the State, and that they knew the regulations could change.\n\u00b675 With respect to the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action,\u201d the District Court concluded that 1-143 was a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power. The District Court cited to ample authority demonstrating that when a state exercise of police power is valid, \u201cits actions may injure investment-backed expectations with respect to commerce in the goods at issue without having to pay compensation.\u201d One line of authority on which the District Court placed particular reliance was a series of prohibition-era cases showing that state action could put an industry completely out of business without having to pay just compensation so long as the state action was a valid exercise of police power. E.g., Mugler v. Kan., 123 U.S. 623, 8 S. Ct. 273 (1887); James Everard\u2019s Breweries v. Day, 265 U.S. 545, 44 S. Ct. 628 (1924). Further, the District Court found that 1-143 prohibited only one use of the alternative livestock \u2014 i.e., charging a fee to shoot them \u2014 and that otherwise appellants maintained all their rights and property interests in the alternative livestock. As a result, 1-143 left appellants \u201cfree to make other economically viable use of their property, removing only one potential use that has been validly deemed to be injurious to public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d\n\u00b676 Appellants challenge the District Court\u2019s application of each of the Penn Central factors. With respect to the economic impact of 1-143, appellants assert that the District' Court improperly relied on the lack of a taxable profit in their tax returns, and failed to appreciate the impact 1-143 had on their alternative livestock and real estate interests.\n\u00b677 Under the \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations\u201d factor, appellants assert the District Court was wrong to conclude that their expectations were not reasonable, in spite of the fact that the Game Farm industry was highly regulated. They assert that 1-143 was not in fact a regulation of the Game Farm industry, but instead a prohibition against Game Farms which destroyed their property. Appellants maintain that they reasonably expected some changes in the regulations governing the Game Farm industry, but that it is not reasonable to expect them to anticipate a regulatory change, based on the whims of Montana voters, which would wipe out the in-state market for fee-shooting. Appellants cite to Cienega Gardens and NRG Co. v. United States., 24 Fed. Cl. 51 (Cl. Ct. 1991) in support of their argument under this factor.\n\u00b678 With respect to the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d factor, appellants criticize the District Court for focusing too much on whether 1-143 was a valid exercise of the State\u2019s police power, and too little on the actual purpose behind takings jurisprudence: to prevent the government from forcing a few individuals to bear an economic burden which should be borne by society as a whole. In light of Lingle, appellants\u2019 argue it is legally inappropriate to conduct a \u201cmeans-ends\u201d analysis to determine whether 1-143 substantially advances legitimate state interests. Instead, they argue, the proper focus should be on the nature of the interference with appellants\u2019 property interests and whether 1-143 requires appellants to unfairly shoulder the economic burden of eliminating the in-state market for fee-shooting.\n\u00b679 With these arguments in mind, we will examine the appellants\u2019 remaining compensable property interests under the Penn Central factors.\nC. Appellants\u2019 Real Estate Interests and Fixtures\n\u00b680 The District Court correctly determined that 1-143 did not effect a taking of appellants\u2019 real estate interests, including appellants\u2019 land and the fixtures constructed for the purpose of operating Game Farms. In this regard, we find the \u201ceconomic impact\u201d factor dispositive because Appellants presented no evidence to support their claims that 1-143 had a measurable economic impact on their lands and fixtures.\n\u00b681 The State presented expert testimony and evidence at trial which showed that the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of appellants\u2019 lands were for uses other than Game Farms, and that they all retained significant value in spite of 1-143; indeed, most of those lands even appreciated. Other than simply disagreeing with this view, appellants offered no evidence-such as appraisals of their own-to support the contention that these findings were clearly erroneous. Indeed, appellants\u2019 experts admitted at trial that they had conducted no appraisals of the real property or fixtures themselves. Instead, appellants presented expert testimony to the effect that 1-143 constituted a categorical taking of their businesses and the Licenses themselves. But the District Court was correct to give no weight to this expert testimony, because those interests are not compensable under the circumstances at bar. Moreover, a review of the expert opinions presented by appellants shows that these experts did not understand how the Penn Central takings analysis is actually applied by the courts.\n\u00b682 There was testimony from Mr. Bridgewater that his property was less marketable without an operating Game Farm, but at any rate it is equally true that the Bridgewaters\u2019 land had appreciated 100% since its date of purchase. Additionally, while the Kafkas contended that certain restrictive covenants in their title documents precluded the alternative uses which the State\u2019s appraisal deemed appropriate, the District Court adequately addressed this issue by taking notice of the fact that these covenants had been removed by the Kafkas and Hill County, and did not impair the marketability of their lands for uses other than Game Farms.\n\u00b683 Applying the \u201cparcel as a whole\u201d standard to appellants\u2019 real estate interests, including their land and fixtures, we find that the \u201ceconomic impact\u201d factor weighs overwhelmingly against finding a compensable taking. Appellants have not shown that 1-143 had any economic impact on their lands, and have not presented evidence to counter the weight of the State\u2019s evidence. In short, they provide no basis to assert a taking of their real estate interests, regardless of the weight of the remaining two factors. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in concluding 1-143 did not constitute a regulatory taking of appellants\u2019 compensable property interests in their lands.\nD. Alternative Livestock\n\u00b684 Next we turn to appellants\u2019 claim that their alternative livestock was \u201ctaken\u201d by 1-143. Returning to the Penn Central analysis, we will first examine the economic impact of 1-143. In this connection, we agree with appellants that the District Court underestimated the economic impact that 1-143 had on their alternative livestock. Unlike their real estate interests, appellants\u2019 have demonstrated that their alternative livestock suffered a significant devaluation as a result of 1-143. Prior to 1-143, the Kafkas received approximately $5,000 to $6,000 per head of alternative livestock; after 1-143 that figure was reduced to $1,700 to $1,800. This represented a devaluation of roughly 70%. The District Court had evidence before it suggesting similar or greater devaluations for both the Bridgewaters and the Boumas, although it did not cite to this evidence in its order. According to the record, the Bridgewaters once had received approximately $8,000 to $9,000 for each head, while after 1-143 they sold 160 head to an out-of-state interest for approximately $80,000, representing a price of around $500 per head, or a roughly 95% devaluation. The Boumas had sold their animals for roughly $5,000 a head before 1-143, while after its passage they received $500 per head. These figures show a devaluation in the neighborhood of 90%.\n\u00b685 Moreover, the facts in the record support the view that this diminished value was insufficient to even cover the cost of raising and maintaining those livestock. While there do exist some markets for their alternative livestock either for meat or antlers, or for resale to out-of-state markets, the return from such activities is less than the actual cost of maintaining the alternative livestock. In other words, after I-143, appellants could only sell the alternative livestock at a loss. This factor weighs in favor of finding a compensable taking of appellants\u2019 alternative livestock.\n\u00b686 We turn next to the second Penn Central factor, the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action.\u201d We start with the proposition that 1-143 places the economic burden of eliminating Game Farms in Montana squarely on the shoulders of individuals, like the appellants, who have entered into this industry in reliance on the continued legality of fee-shooting. As such, it seems to run afoul of one of the primary policy concerns animating takings jurisprudence, namely the notion that the Takings Clause \u201cbar[s] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563, 1569 (1960). Whatever the rationale for preventing fee-shooting, it is clear that individuals like appellants, and not the public as a whole, are being asked to bear the burden.\n\u00b687 However, the type of intrusion upon the alternative livestock embodied by 1-143 is minimal. The animals have not been seized by virtue of I-143-they still belong to the appellants. Moreover, Appellants may still sell their animals to out-of-state markets for any usage, and may even allow others to shoot them in Montana, so long as no fee is charged. It is well-established that regulations which impair or significantly decrease the profitable use of property do not amount to a taking. In Andrus, for instance, the Supreme Court held that an act of Congress which banned the sale and transfer of eagle feathers, did not amount to a taking of the eagle feathers because the property holders still maintained the rest of the bundle of rights, and could still make some minimal use of the eagle feathers. Andrus, 444 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S. Ct. at 327. The Supreme Court acknowledged that the act deprived claimants of the ability to make profitable use of the eagle feathers, but declined to find a taking in large measure because they did not have a right, under the Takings Clause to make profitable use of the eagle feathers. \u201c[T]he denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full \u2018bundle\u2019 of property rights, the destruction of one \u2018strand\u2019 of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety.\u201d Andrus, 444 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S. Ct. at 327.\n\u00b688 Thus, the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d with respect to the animals is minimally intrusive. If the nature of the intrusion was greater and 1-143 affected other segments of appellants\u2019 bundle of rights in the alternative livestock, such as their right to sell the live animals or slaughter them for market, then this factor might lean more in their favor because appellants, and not the general public, are shouldering this burden. As it stands, however, the intrusion is so slight that this factor must weigh against finding a compensable taking.\n\u00b689 Thus we turn to the final Penn Central factor, \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations.\u201d With respect to the alternative livestock, appellants\u2019 investment-backed expectations were that they could charge a fee to shoot them. Indeed, that is why they expended significant financial resources on their respective operations to begin with. The District Court acknowledged these expectations but concluded that they \u201cmust be legally tempered by the objective reality that they were engaged in a highly regulated and speculative new industry.\u201d While one can maintain reasonable investment-backed expectations in highly-regulated industries, e.g., Ruckleshaus, 467 U.S. at 1010-11, 104 S. Ct. at 2877 (finding reasonable investment-backed expectations in the pesticide industry), United Nuclear Corp. v. United States., 912 F.2d 1432, 1436-37 (Fed. Cir 1990) (finding distinct investment-backed expectations in the mining industry), we agree with the view, as articulated by the District Court, that the regulated and speculative nature of a particular industry should be considered in determining whether investment-backed expectations are reasonable. In this case, then, the question becomes whether it was reasonable for appellants to maintain an investment-backed expectation that they would always be able to charge a fee to shoot alternative livestock in Montana, and that the State could or would not interfere with this expectation. We find that such an expectation is not reasonable; thus, this factor weighs against finding a compensable taking of appellants\u2019 alternative livestock.\n\u00b690 In this regard, the facts at bar distinguish this case from both Cienega Gardens and NRG Co., the two cases upon which Appellants rely. In Cienega Gardens, owners of low-income apartments sued the government for an unconstitutional taking after Congress nullified their contractual rights to prepay forty-year mortgage loans entered into with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) after a period of twenty years. Cienega Gardens, 331 F.3d at 1323. This congressional action was significant to the owners because so long as they participated in the HUD loan program, they were forced to charge rental rates far below market value. The Federal Court of Appeals agreed and found that the term in their contract with the Government guaranteeing them the right to exit the HUD program after twenty years by paying off their loans was \u201can explicit and material term of their mortgage contracts [and] simply not a change the ... Plaintiffs should have anticipated.\u201d Cienega Gardens, 331 F.3d at 1351.\n\u00b691 Similarly, in NRG Co., the Federal Claims Court found an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment when Congress cancelled mining prospecting permits held by several private companies. NRG Co., 24 Cl. Ct. at 52-55. In that case, the U.S. Government issued permits to several private companies, but Congress later unilaterally cancelled those permits, and related leases, out of concerns that the proposed mining operations would negatively impact Indian tribes on whose lands those operations would be conducted. NRG Co., 24 Cl. Ct. at 55-56. In analyzing the companies\u2019 regulatory takings claims, the Claims Court found the companies had reasonable investment-backed expectations that, once they obtained the permits, they would have the option to obtain valuable mineral leases, and that the congressional acts cancelling those permits after they had already been issued was not reasonably within those investment-backed expectations. NRG Co., 24 Cl. Ct. at 61-63.\n\u00b692 Here by contrast, the State never assured appellants they would always be permitted to charge a fee to shoot alternative livestock in Montana. Further, we agree with the District Court that appellants knew, or should have known, that Game Farm operations were highly controversial in Montana and that initiative measures could have been passed which would outlaw Game Farms entirely. The record is clear that FWP was aware of the significant public unrest and imparted this information to the Kafkas beginning in 1996. See \u00b6 12. Other appellants should have been aware of these same facts. Nothing in the regulations, Licenses, or statutes, provides any assurance that the regulations could not be changed and appellants received no guarantees from the State that their operations would continue to be lawful.\n\u00b693 We conclude that appellants should have reasonably anticipated that the Game Farm industry might be phased out due to health and safety-related concerns over CWD, or even that the State might make the regulatory burden of participating in this field so onerous that Game Farms would no longer be profitable enterprises. In other words, appellants could not maintain a reasonable investment-backed expectation that they would be permanently insulated against the possibility that the Game Farm industry would be either regulated so as to eliminate its profitability, or completely abolished. As a result, since appellants could have reasonably anticipated the complete elimination of Game Farms by the State or regulations that would make participation in the field unprofitable, they should have also anticipated that the State could make the operations less profitable by eliminating the in-state market for fee-shooting. Although appellants may not have specifically anticipated the passage and enactment of I-143, the practical effect of I-143-i.e., the elimination of the in-state market for fee-shooting-should have been within their reasonable investment-backed expectations, given the absence of assurances on this point from the State. Accordingly, the \u201creasonable investment-backed expectation\u201d factor weighs against finding a compensable taking of appellants\u2019 livestock.\n\u00b694 The Penn Central test ultimately calls for a weighing or balancing of these factors in order \u201cto identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082. Utilizing this approach, we have concluded that the purported taking here is not the functional equivalent of a direct appropriation of property, nor does it constitute an ouster from appellants\u2019 domain. In weighing these factors together, we are mindful of the admonition that \u201c[resolution of each case ... ultimately calls as much for the exercise of judgment as for the application of logic.\u201d Andrus, 444 U.S. at 65, 100 S. Ct. at 327. After weighing the effects of 1-143 under the Penn Central factors, and particularly the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d factor, we conclude that appellants are not entitled to just compensation for the regulatory taking of their alternative livestock.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b695 In summary, we affirm the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding appellants\u2019 claims for compensation with respect to their Licenses, the goodwill and other intangible assets of their businesses, their real estate and fixtures, and their alternative livestock.\nCHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICE LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE CHRISTOPHER, sitting for JUSTICE WARNER, concur.\n\u201cCWD isa fatal disease of the central nervous system of captive and free-ranging mule deer, white-tailed deer, and Rocky Mountain elk.\u201d Hagener v.

INTRODUCTION\n\u00b696 We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.\n\u00b697 Ninety-one years ago, the State of Montana made it a lawful \u201cbusiness or occupation\u201d to acquire, breed, own, harvest, sell, and otherwise control privately owned game animals on alternative livestock ranches. As recently as 1999, the State suggested this as \u201ca viable economic opportunity\u201d for any private property owner, as well as the traditional livestock producers who were interested in diversifying their ranch productivity. Although the State regulated alternative livestock ranching, the regulatory scheme provided that these businesses could continue so long as the owner paid the licensing fee each year and complied with all recording and reporting requirements. Among other things, the State sanctioned \u201cfee shooting,\u201d where members of the public could pay to shoot a preselected animal on an alternative livestock ranch under the supervision of a guide. Indisputably, fee shooting was the primary source of income for the alternative livestock businesses.\n\u00b698 With the State\u2019s blessing, and in reliance on this governmental enabling, the Kafkas, the Bridgewaters, and the Boumas (collectively, \u201cthe Ranchers\u201d) invested substantial capital and resources to create going concerns. But then the State turned around and told the Ranchers that while they could continue to acquire, breed, and harvest their alternative livestock, they could no longer charge a fee for hunting the livestock. In thus prohibiting remuneration for the key economic activity on which the Ranchers\u2019 businesses depended, the State effectively legislated those businesses out of existence. The State zeroed out the Ranchers\u2019 intangible assets (e.g., goodwill and going-concern value) and left them with a collection of tangibles whose value was either worthless or substantially diminished.\n\u00b699 The Court holds today that the Ranchers are not entitled under the United States Constitution or the Montana Constitution to any compensation for the obliteration of their businesses caused by the passage of Initiative No. 143 (\u201cInitiative\u201d or \u201c1-143\u201d) in November 2000. The Court acknowledges that the Ranchers suffered substantial property devaluation as a result of the Initiative, but the Court decides that such loss is not compensable because the State did not physically condemn or occupy the Ranchers\u2019 property and because the Ranchers should have anticipated a prohibition on charging a fee for alternative livestock hunts. As will surely come as a surprise to many Montana business owners, the Court announces that, absent an explicit \u201cassurance\u201d from the State, the businessman or businesswoman has no reasonable expectation in being able to receive remuneration for the goods and services he or she provides. Thus, when the State says, \u201cGo ahead and market your products, but don\u2019t charge anything for them,\u201d the business owner is simply out of luck if his or her business is destroyed as a result.\n\u00b6100 At bottom, the Court holds that any individual in this State who, with the State\u2019s encouragement, invests capital and resources to create a going concern, but who does so in a field that this Court considers \u201chighly controversial,\u201d simply has no compensable interest in that business. Therefore, when the State up and decides to legislate the business out of existence-through the unique expedient of depriving the business of any income-the State need not provide any compensation for the owner\u2019s loss of property.\n\u00b6101 The injustice in treating Montana businesspeople and property owners in this manner is manifest, not to mention legally indefensible. I strenuously disagree with the Court\u2019s determination that the Ranchers, and others similarly situated, are without a remedy for a taking of their property. I also cannot subscribe to the Court\u2019s faulty rationales in reaching this result. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.\nII. PRELIMINARY MATTERS\n\u00b6102 The issues in this case are unquestionably complex, in large part because takings jurisprudence itself is \u201ca confused body of law containing contradictory principles and standards.\u201d John D. Echeverria & Sharon Dennis, The Takings Issue and the Due Process Clause: A Way Out of a Doctrinal Confusion, 17 Vt. L. Rev. 695, 696 (1993). The Court, the District Court, the State, and the Sportsmen have further confounded the proper resolution of this case by mischaracterizing the impact of 1-143 on the Ranchers\u2019 property interests and by injecting into this case a number of inapt legal theories and irrelevant factual matters. For these reasons, and to lay the foundation for my analysis of the Ranchers\u2019 claims, I first address the following four subjects:\nA. The regulatory history of alternative livestock ranching.\nB. The purpose and impact of 1-143.\nC. Inapplicability of police power/noxious use theory.\nD. Misplaced reliance on due process considerations.\nAfter clarifying these preliminary matters in Part II, I proceed in Part III with an analysis of the Ranchers\u2019 entitlement to just compensation for a taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nA. The Regulatory History of Alternative Livestock Ranching\n\u00b6103 On March 15, 1917, the Montana Legislature passed an act which, among other things, declared it lawful for any person, company, or association to engage in the \u201cbusiness or occupation\u201d of propagating, owning, and controlling wild game animals of this State upon premises owned, leased, or controlled by such person, company, or association. Laws of Montana 1917, ch. 173, \u00a7 84, as amended, Laws of Montana 1919, ch. 200, \u00a7 1, codified at \u00a7 3777, RCM (1921). The business owner was required to pay an annual license fee and comply with any regulations prescribed by the State Fish and Game Commission. In addition, a statement of the place where \u201csuch business\u201d was to be conducted and the game proposed to be raised on said premises had to be filed with the Commission. Section 3777, RCM. To this end, upon obtaining a permit from the Commission, the business owner was authorized \u201cto capture alive such ... game quadrupeds as may be necessary for foundation stock for such game farm.\u201d Section 3777, RCM. Finally, once the game farm was \u201cin successful operation,\u201d the owner was authorized to \u201csell, transfer, or dispose of the game so bred and raised by him, as he might do with domestic live stock, and without restriction so to do.\u201d Section 3777, RCM.\n\u00b6104 The statutory scheme underwent a number of revisions in 1925, 1933, and 1947. Most of these changes are not pertinent to the instant appeal, though the following are worth noting. In 1925, the Legislature added an explicit fencing requirement and made it unlawful for any person to enter a properly fenced game farm without the owner\u2019s consent. See Laws of Montana 1925, ch. 192, \u00a7 31. The Legislature also provided that \u201cthe product of such game or fur-farm may be dealt with and sold as private property,\u201d Laws of Montana 1925, ch. 192, \u00a7 31, codified at \u00a7 3777, RCM (1935); however, this language was not carried forward in the 1947 version of the statute, see \u00a7 26-1201, RCM (1947). In 1947, the Legislature clarified that a permit must be procured \u201cbefore\u201d establishing a game farm but that a game farm permit \u201cshall\u201d be issued to \u201cresponsible\u201d applicants who own or lease, and have properly fenced, the premises on which their operations are to be conducted. Laws of Montana 1947, ch. 120, \u00a7 1. Thereafter, the statutory scheme remained substantially unchanged through 1982.\n\u00b6105 In March 1982, Governor Ted Schwinden appointed a 13-member Game Farm Task Force-consisting of sportsmen, game farm operators, bird farm owners, ranchers, and state officials-to develop definitive legislation addressed to concerns about game farming in Montana. The culmination of the task force\u2019s work, Senate Bill No. 448 (\u201cSB 448\u201d), was passed by the 1983 Legislature. It repealed the existing game farm laws and replaced them with an entirely new statutory framework. See Laws of Montana 1983, ch. 570. Among other things, the new scheme clarified that all game farm animals lawfully raised on a licensed game farm \u201care the private property of the licensee,\u201d \u00a7 87-4-414(1), MCA (1983); that the licensee \u201cmay acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, capture, kill, use, sell, or dispose of the game farm animals and their progeny in any quantity, at any time of year, and in any manner, as long as he complies with the requirements of [Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA],\u201d \u00a7 87-4-414(2), MCA; and that the laws applicable to game animals do not apply to game farm animals on a licensed game farm, \u00a7 87-4-414(4), MCA. The hunting and sale of game farm animals was explicitly recognized in \u00a7\u00a7 87-4-414(3), -415(1), and -421, MCA. Persons wishing to operate a game farm were still required to obtain a license, see \u00a7\u00a7 87-4-407, -409, MCA; however, once obtained, renewal of the license was a matter of right \u201cupon payment of the renewal fee if the licensee has not violated any provision under which the license was granted,\u201d \u00a7 87-4-412(1), MCA. Finally, the reporting requirements were set out in greater detail than previously. Compare \u00a7 87-4-404, MCA (1981), with \u00a7 87-4-417, MCA (1983).\n\u00b6106 Notably, the original version of SB 448 differed in a number of critical respects from the proposed legislation submitted by the Game Farm Task Force. Among other things, the drafters of SB 448 gave the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks discretion as to whether a game farm license would be issued (assuming the game farm application was otherwise in order) by replacing the word \u201cshall\u201d with the word \u201cmay\u201d in several places. The drafters also revised the provision regarding the renewal of licenses such that renewal would not be a matter of right. These sorts of changes prompted a somewhat scathing rejoinder by counsel representing the interests of game farm operators. In a February 1983 letter (which is part of the legislative history of SB 448), counsel pointed out that the proposed legislation submitted by the drafters \u201cviolated the intent\u201d of the proposed legislation submitted by the Game Farm Task Force. At stake here, he stated, was \u201cthe private property right that every individual has to raise livestock as long as he complies with the other provisions of the Act as was discussed in the task force.\u201d Counsel stated that unless the language of SB 448 was amended so that \u201cit represents what the task force agreed upon and does not take away any rights that we negotiated,\u201d he would oppose the bill. Ultimately, his concerns were taken into account, and the final version of SB 448 passed by the Legislature, as described above, included the \u201crights\u201d sought by the game farm operators and negotiated by the Game Farm Task Force.\n\u00b6107 The statutory scheme enacted in 1983 remained in place through November 6, 2000 (the day before 1-143 went into effect), though various provisions were amended or added over the years. For instance, in 1993, the Legislature adopted new procedures and criteria for the issuance and revocation of game farm licenses, including additional fencing and enclosure requirements, and authorized licensees to transfer their game farm licenses. See Laws of Montana 1993, ch. 315, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 6, 12. The Legislature also eliminated the \u201cshooting license\u201d that game farmers had been required to obtain before allowing anyone to hunt on their property. See Laws of Montana 1993, ch. 315, \u00a7 7. In 1999, the term \u201cgame farm\u201d was changed to \u201calternative livestock ranch.\u201d See Laws of Montana 1999, ch. 574, \u00a7 7. In addition, the Legislature added a provision explicitly recognizing the production of alternative livestock as \u201ca viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.\u201d Laws of Montana 1999, ch. 574, \u00a7 1.\n\u00b6108 The substance of the statutory scheme as it relates to the instant appeal, however, remained substantially unchanged. All alternative livestock lawfully possessed on a licensed alternative livestock ranch were the licensee\u2019s \u201cprivate property,\u201d which the licensee could \u201cbreed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of ... in any quantity and at any time of year.\u201d Section 87-4-414(1), (2) MCA (1999). Annual renewal of the alternative livestock ranch license was a matter of right under \u00a7 87-4-412(1), MCA, which instructed the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks to renew each license \u201cupon payment of the renewal fee if the licensee has complied with all recording and reporting requirements.\u201d Lastly, each license was transferable if certain criteria were met. Section 87-4-412(2), MCA.\n\u00b6109 So, to sum up this historical background, although the regulatory scheme went through a number of adjustments between 1917 and 2000, it was always a lawful \u201cbusiness or occupation\u201d to acquire, breed, own, harvest, sell, and otherwise control privately owned game animals on an alternative livestock ranch. Furthermore, while the regulations designed to protect native wildlife (through safety and fencing requirements) became increasingly detailed and rigorous, so did the regulations designed to protect the business owners\u2019 interests (through explicit recognition of their alternative livestock as \u201cprivate property\u201d and their businesses as \u201cviable economic opportunities,\u201d and through the guarantee that their licenses would be renewed each year upon payment of the renewal fee and compliance with all recording and reporting requirements).\nB. The Purpose and Impact of I-I43\n\u00b6110 On November 7, 2000, the voters passed 1-143, which altered the statutory scheme in several significant respects. See generally Laws of Montana 2001, 2000 Ballot Issues, Initiative No. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 1-9. First, it prohibited the establishment of any new alternative livestock ranches. See \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4. Second, it revoked the right of existing alternative livestock ranch operators to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses. See \u00a7 4. Lastly, it prohibited \u201cthe shooting of game animals or alternative livestock... for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.\u201d See \u00a7 6. These amendments took effect immediately. See \u00a7 11.\n\u00b6111 The Sportsmen have sought in this Court to portray 1-143 as creating nothing more than a few \u201cadditional restrictions\u201d on alternative livestock ranching. They assert that these \u201cadditional restrictions\u201d are not so onerous as to amount to a taking of private property. The District Court likewise characterized 1-143 as merely an \u201cextension\u201d of the existing regulatory framework. Remarkably, this Court minimizes the impact of 1-143 even further, declaring it to be only a \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cminimally intrusive\u201d burden on the Ranchers\u2019 property interests. For the reasons which follow, these characterizations are baseless and patently misleading.\n\u00b6112 The Sportsmen inform us that they conceived, designed, and drafted 1-143 \u201cto address specific dangers stemming from the proliferation of game farms in this state.\u201d They list a number of such dangers: the threat posed by alternative livestock ranches to Montana\u2019s \u201cproud heritage of ethical hunting\u201d; the increased risk of disease (e.g., chronic wasting disease), hybridization, and competition to native wildlife posed by alternative livestock interacting with native elk and deer (as a result of escape, or nose-to-nose contact through the fence); and the \u201cEuropean style\u201d privatization of wildlife. The Sportsmen also report that they opposed and sought to prohibit the \u201cpenned hunts\u201d offered by many alternative livestock ranches. They note that this practice, which they criticize as \u201ca sport for the wealthy,\u201d had become a \u201cposter child\u201d for anti-hunting groups. Finally, although the Legislature took action in 2000 to address concerns over chronic wasting disease-see Laws of Montana 2001, May 2000 Special Session, ch. 1 (imposing a moratorium on new applications for initial alternative livestock ranch licenses \u201cuntil a live test for chronic wasting disease is developed and is approved by the department of livestock\u201d)-the Sportsmen assert that \u201cthe problems\u201d associated with alternative livestock ranches were not \u201cadequately addressed\u201d by the legislative action. The Sportsmen thus characterize 1-143 as \u201cvital\u201d to the protection of Montana\u2019s wildlife, to the availability of plentiful populations of big game, and to the preservation of Montana\u2019s proud tradition of hunting these animals under fair-chase conditions. They conclude that 1-143 serves \u201cweighty\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d purposes.\n\u00b6113 Yet, notwithstanding the Sportsmen\u2019s concerns with disease, fair-chase hunting ethics, and privatization of wildlife, the Ranchers\u2019 activities remain lawful and state-sanctioned in most respects. 1-143 did not revoke their alternative livestock ranch licenses, confiscate their alternative livestock, or impose stricter regulations on the care and management of the livestock. As a matter of fact, the Initiative does not prohibit the Ranchers from continuing to acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock. Section 87-4-414(2), MCA (2001). The Initiative allows the Ranchers to keep penned elk, in spite of the concern about contact between wild ungulates and alternative livestock and the concern about transmission of diseases through intermediate hosts. The Initiative also allows \u201cpenned hunts,\u201d in spite of the concern with preserving Montana\u2019s tradition of ethical fair-chase hunting. And the Initiative allows private ownership of alternative livestock, \u00a7 87-4-414(1), MCA, in spite of the concern over European-style privatization of wildlife. In short, 1-143 neither outlawed alternative livestock ranches nor directly addressed any of the concerns cited by the Sportsmen in support of the Initiative. (The Sportsmen\u2019s concerns were set out in the Proponents\u2019 arguments included with the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet.) 1-143 did not create new regulations concerning fencing, it did not create new testing requirements for diseases, and people can still shoot privately owned penned elk. 1-143 actually addressed none of the \u201cweighty\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d purposes for which it was promoted to the voters.\n\u00b6114 The reason for all of this is simple: The Sportsmen\u2019s ultimate goal was to shut down all alternative livestock businesses, and in drafting 1-143, they recognized the constitutional implications of doing so outright. As explained by counsel for the Sportsmen during oral argument in the companion case, Buhmann v. State (No. 05-473):\nThere was a recognition by my clients that if they passed a statute that simply said, \u201cEvery game farm is done tomorrow,\u201d that that would be a very difficult takings claim to defend against. And we didn\u2019t want to have to go down that road. And so the statute was carefully crafted to address the problem in a way that was not offensive to taking but at the same time benefitted the wildlife and the wildlife management of this State.\n\u00b6115 Thus, in a striking display of legerdemain, the Sportsmen devised the \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d solution of imposing a ban on charging a fee for what remains a lawful activity in this State: shooting alternative livestock on alternative livestock ranches. They recognized that because the value of each alternative livestock business derived from its ability to sell \u201cpenned hunts,\u201d 1-143 would effectively shut those businesses down by prohibiting remuneration for such hunts. Indeed, as the District Court aptly observed: \u201c1-143 does appear to have been intentionally crafted in such a way that would for all intents and purposes snuff out alternative livestock ranching and in the process possibly save the State from footing the bill in the event it was found that the obvious takings were compensable.\u201d Likewise, despite its attempts elsewhere in the Opinion to minimize the impact of 1-143, the Court acknowledges that the Initiative\u2019s prohibition on fee shooting effectively \u201coutlaw[ed] Game Farms entirely.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 92. Similarly, the Attorney General\u2019s explanatory statement of 1-143 in the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet points out that \u201c[ajbolishing fee shooting may force closure of some game farms.\u201d Notably absent from the Voter Information Pamphlet, however, is any acknowledgement that the State might have to foot the bill for destroying the Ranchers\u2019 property rights. As a result, the voters were never required to weigh the costs and benefits of taking the Ranchers\u2019 property. They were simply asked whether an initiative \u201cprohibiting new game farms, prohibiting transfer of existing game farm licenses, and prohibiting shooting of game farm animals for a fee\u201d should be approved, given the dire public need described by the Proponents.\n\u00b6116 In blunt terms, the Sportsmen determined to rid Montana of a perceived blight, but euthanizing the Ranchers outright was thought to be too \u201coffensive\u201d and costly. So, they decided instead to pull the plug on the Ranchers\u2019 life-support. That way, they could argue that the Ranchers died of natural causes and that the State, therefore, bears no responsibility. Counsel\u2019s assertion that this transparent charade is \u201cnot offensive\u201d to the guarantee of just compensation for a taking of private property is dubious, if not preposterous. Moreover, that this ruse was wrapped in the mantle of Montana\u2019s \u201cproud heritage of ethical hunting\u201d is a stain on the sport that the Sportsmen purport to protect.\n\u00b6117 Even more troubling is the Court\u2019s decision to ratify this end-around the Constitution\u2019s just compensation requirement. This constitutional guarantee is worthless when the Court allows it to be circumvented by means of a \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d political ploy. Moreover, the purpose of the constitutional guarantee is undermined when property rights can be devalued with no thought whatsoever as to the burdens and benefits involved. From the taxpayers\u2019 perspective, it is easy and painless to vote for an initiative such as 1-143 when this Court holds that the government is free to take property without having to pay for it. Yet, if government regulation involves \u201cadjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good,\u201d Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 2659 (1978), then taxpayers should be required to weigh the costs of taking property against the expected public benefits of doing so. In point of fact, this weighing is mandated by fairness, efficiency, and the Constitution.\n\u00b6118 Given the Sportsmen\u2019s goals in drafting 1-143, it is disingenuous to argue, as the Sportsmen do, that the Ranchers have not suffered a taking of private property under the \u201cadditional restrictions\u201d created by 1-143 because the Initiative merely \u201cmodified\u201d their alternative livestock ranch licenses and because the Ranchers \u201ccan continue operating as a game farm, albeit less profitably.\u201d The Court\u2019s assertion that 1-143 made the Ranchers\u2019 operations only \u201cless profitable\u201d is similarly far-fetched. Opinion, \u00b6 93. The purpose of 1-143, as admitted by the Sportsmen themselves, was not to create a few \u201cadditional restrictions\u201d (e.g., new testing and fencing regulations) that might incidentally make the business of alternative livestock ranching less profitable. The Initiative\u2019s purpose, rather, was to eliminate the economic viability of these businesses entirely and thereby make it unfeasible for the Ranchers and other alternative livestock business owners to operate their ranches at all. In this connection, the Sportsmen and the Court concede that the Ranchers invested in specialized equipment, inventory, and fixtures and expended significant financial resources to develop their property for the specific purpose of fee shooting. Moreover, the Court acknowledges that as a result of I-143, the value of the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock was diminished to such an extent that the Ranchers are no longer able to cover the cost of raising and maintaining the livestock. Opinion, \u00b6 85. Simply put, 1-143 was designed to shut down all alternative livestock businesses, and it succeeded in doing so. It is irrelevant that this was accomplished in a less direct and expeditious manner than passing a statute that simply said, \u201cEvery game farm is done tomorrow.\u201d The result-destruction of the Ranchers\u2019 businesses-is clearly the same.\n\u00b6119 Ultimately, the Sportsmen\u2019s assertion that 1-143 served \u201cweighty\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d purposes is immaterial to our resolution of this appeal. The District Court and several other courts have already concluded that 1-143 furthered legitimate state interests, and the Ranchers have not appealed these conclusions. See Kafka v. Hagener, 176 F. Supp. 2d 1037, 1042 (D. Mont. 2001); Or. on Mot. to Dismiss (Dkt. 40) at 4, Kafka v. Montana Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, DV-02-059 (Mont. Dist. Oct. 21, 2002); Spoklie v. Montana, 411 F.3d 1051, 1059 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Hagener v. Wallace, 2002 MT 109, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28, 309 Mont. 473, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28, 47 P.3d 847, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. Rather, the point of this discussion is that 1-143 was intended to shut down the alternative livestock industry without the State\u2019s having to pay for it, and thus the Sportsmen\u2019s and the Court\u2019s portrayals of 1-143 as something other than it is-as merely a slight, minimally intrusive \u201cadjustment\u201d of the regulatory scheme-are implausible. Indeed, they are flat wrong. The Court even contradicts itself by arguing on one hand that 1-143 amounts to a \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cminimally intrusive\u201d burden on the Ranchers\u2019 property interests, Opinion, \u00b6 88, but on the other hand that the Ranchers \u201cshould have reasonably anticipated that the Game Farm industry might be phased out,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 93. \u201cPhasing out\u201d an entire industry is certainly not the result one would reasonably anticipate from a regulation whose intrusion on property interests is \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cminimally intrusive.\u201d\n\u00b6120 In any event, the fact is that 1-143 did not adjust the regulatory scheme as the amendments over the preceding 83 years had done. Rather, it rendered the regulatory scheme entirely pointless, since none of the businesses in the industry can exist economically after 1-143, which was the admitted purpose of the Initiative from the outset.\nC. Inapplicability of Police Power/Noxious Use Theory\n\u00b6121 Citing Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 8 S. Ct. 273 (1887), the State argues that \u201cthe government can ban commerce that it deems to be injurious to public health, safety, and welfare without having to compensate the traffickers in such commerce for the loss of their businesses.\u201d Likewise, during oral argument, the State emphasized the theory that the Ranchers are not entitled to any compensation because 1-143 is \u201ca valid police power regulation\u201d necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The State asserted on this basis that this Court has \u201cno choice\u201d but to affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.\n\u00b6122 In rejecting the Ranchers\u2019 takings claims, the District Court articulated a similar theory based on Mugler:\nThe State has the power to determine that certain commerce is injurious to the welfare of the State and its citizens, and to regulate or even outlaw that commerce. The State has done so here with respect to the fee-shooting prohibition in 1-143. When the State does so, its actions may injure investment-backed expectations with respect to commerce in the goods at issue without having to pay compensation.\n\u00b6123 The Court remarks that \u201cample authority\u201d supports the District Court\u2019s reasoning. Opinion, \u00b6 75. According to the Court, this \u201cample authority\u201d demonstrates the State may put an industry completely out of business without having to pay just compensation, so long as the state action was a valid exercise of its police power. Opinion, \u00b6 75. In this connection, the Court observes that the activity targeted by 1-143 was \u201c \u2018validly deemed to be injurious to public health, safety, and welfare.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 75 (quoting the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law). The Court does not identify what the injurious byproducts of charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock were, but it appears that the Court has the Sportsmen\u2019s concerns in mind (i.e., diseases, unethical hunting, and private ownership of game animals), given that the Court refers to these repeatedly throughout its Opinion.\n\u00b6124 The State insists that Mugler is \u201cstill viewed as authoritative under modern taking jurisprudence.\u201d As authority for this contention, the State cites Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992), Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 107 S. Ct. 1232 (1987), and Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 100 S. Ct. 318 (1979). In addition, the State asserted during oral argument that Mugler \u201ccontinues to be cited as good law,\u201d since \u201cit was cited last term by the Court in the Kelo case\u201d-a reference to Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469, 125 S. Ct. 2655 (2005). A careful reading of Kelo, however, reveals that Mugler was cited by one of the dissenting Justices, not by the Kelo majority. See Kelo, 545 U.S. at 519-20, 125 S. Ct. at 2685 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\u00b6125 Although the Ranchers, citing Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 28 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and Whitney Benefits, Inc. v. United States, 926 F.2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1991), argue that Mugler\u2019s validity is suspect, this debate over Mugler\u2019s current vitality is beside the point. For the reasons which follow, Mugler is inapplicable to the case at hand.\n1. The Mugler Decision\n\u00b6126 At the outset, it is necessary to point out that Mugler, which involved a challenge to certain Kansas statutes, was decided on substantive due process grounds. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause was not at issue for the simple reason that, under the law at the time, the Clause was understood as \u201cintended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the government of the United States, and... not applicable to the legislation of the states.\u201d Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243, 250-51 (1833); accord Pumpelly v. Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Co., 80 U.S. 166, 176-77 (1872). Rather, during the period in which Mugler was decided, the \u201cjust compensation\u201d requirement (as applied to state action) was a matter of state constitutional law, natural law, common law, and Fourteenth Amendment due process. See Kris W. Kobach, The Origins of Regulatory Takings: Setting the Record Straight, 1996 Utah L. Rev. 1211, 1229, 1270-76; Bradley C. Karkkainen, The Police Power Revisited: Phantom Incorporation and the Roots of the Takings \u201cMuddle,\u201d 90 Minn. L. Rev. 826, 847-49 (2006); see also Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 236, 17 S. Ct. 581, 584 (1897).\n\u00b6127 The question in Mugler was whether state statutes prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors (except for medical, scientific, and mechanical purposes) violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause or Privileges and Immunities Clause. See Mugler, 123 U.S. at 657, 8 S. Ct. at 295. In answering this question, the Supreme Court first acknowledged the power of the States, known as the \u201cpolice power,\u201d \u201cto control their purely internal affairs, and, in so doing, to protect the health, morals, and safety of their people by regulations that do not interfere with the execution of the powers of the general government, or violate rights secured by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Mugler, 123 U.S. at 659, 8 S. Ct. at 296. The Court decided that the power to regulate or prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, whether for general use or merely personal use, was within the ambit of the state\u2019s police powers. See Mugler, 123 U.S. at 658-63, 8 S. Ct. at 295-98.\n\u00b6128 Next, the Court considered and rejected the contention that Kansas was required under the Fourteenth Amendment to pay just compensation for the resulting devaluation of the appellants\u2019 breweries. See Mugler, 123 U.S. at 664-70, 8 S. Ct. at 298-301. The Court reasoned that \u201call property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner\u2019s use of it shall not be injurious to the community.\u201d Mugler, 123 U.S. at 665, 8 S. Ct. at 299. Thus, where a particular use of property is a nuisance to the surrounding community, the government may exercise its police power to abate the nuisance. Mugler, 123 U.S. at 667, 8 S. Ct. at 300. In explaining that no compensation is required in that situation, the Court stated as follows:\nThe power which the states have of prohibiting such use by individuals of their property, as will be prejudicial to the health, the morals, or the safety of the public, is not-and, consistently with the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be-burdened with the condition that the state must compensate such individual owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community. The exercise of the police power by the destruction of property which is itself a public nuisance, or the prohibition of its use in a particular way, whereby its value becomes depreciated, is very different from taking property for public use, or from depriving a person of his property without due process of law. In the one case, a nuisance only is abated; in the other, unoffending property is taken away from an innocent owner.\nMugler, 123 U.S. at 669, 8 S. Ct. at 301.\n2. Mugler\u2019s Inapplicability to the Case at Hand\n\u00b6129 Seen in its historical context, Mugler stands for the limited proposition that the government need not pay compensation when it exercises its power to prohibit a \u201cnoxious\u201d use of property, i.e., a use akin to a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1010, 1022-23, 1029-30, 112 S. Ct. at 2890, 2896-97, 2900-01 (explaining that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when the state exercises its power to abate a nuisance which affects the public generally). This is so because the right to engage in the noxious use was never in the property owner\u2019s title to begin with; thus, nothing is taken when the state prohibits that use. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029-30, 112 S. Ct. at 2900-01. But this proposition gets the State nowhere in its attempt to avoid paying compensation for the Ranchers\u2019 losses. Alternative livestock ranching, which was done and maintained under the express authority of Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA, was in no way a public nuisance. See \u00a7 27-30-101(2), MCA (\u201cNothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.\u201d). Mugler, therefore, is inapposite.\n\u00b6130 The State suggested otherwise at oral argument, asserting emphatically and with unmistakable disdain that use of alternative livestock for the purpose of fee shooting threatened the public health, safety, and welfare. Likewise, in its appellate brief, the State disparages the Ranchers\u2019 activities as \u201cinjurious to public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d That the State would describe alternative livestock ranching with such smug intolerance is astounding, given that the State not only sanctioned the industry\u2019s existence for 83 years but also facilitated-and even encouraged-the establishment of numerous alternative livestock businesses. Indeed, the State conceded at oral argument that \u201c[t]here is some evidence to suggest that it was the policy of the political branches of government to encourage people to look at game farming as an alternative to traditional agriculture-actually, to subsidize traditional agriculture so they could stay on the farms and ranches.\u201d Yet, at the same time, the State argued that the very activities it had sanctioned and encouraged for 83 years needed to be prohibited in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. This is hypocrisy personified.\n\u00b6131 The State\u2019s condemnation of the alternative livestock industry as some sort of noxious or abhorrent threat to the public health, safety, and welfare rings hollow in light of the State\u2019s role in creating, developing, and nurturing the industry in the first place. That said, any suggestion that no compensation is owed the Ranchers because the State was abating some sort of public nuisance is legally unsustainable. Section 27-30-101(2), MCA. For that matter, the State has provided nothing but conclusory assertions that alternative livestock ranching constituted a public nuisance in the first place.\n\u00b6132 On a related point, as noted above, the District Court reasoned:\nThe State has the power to determine that certain commerce is injurious to the welfare of the State and its citizens, and to regulate or even outlaw that commerce. The State has done so here with respect to the fee-shooting prohibition in 1-143. When the State does so, its actions may injure investment-backed expectations with respect to commerce in the goods at issue without having to pay compensation.\n\u00b6133 This reasoning is legally unsustainable. Assuming, arguendo, that 1-143 reflects a determination by the State that fee shooting is a noxious use of property, it has long been established that the mere declaration by the government that a certain property or use thereof constitutes a nuisance does not make it so. See Yates v. Milwaukee, 77 U.S. 497, 505 (1871); see also Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1031, 112 S. Ct. at 2901-02. Addressing such a declaration in Yates, the Supreme Court observed:\nIt is a doctrine not to be tolerated in this country, that a municipal corporation, without any general laws either of the city or of the state, within which a given structure can be shown to be a nuisance, can, by its mere declaration that it is one, subject it to removal by any person supposed to be aggrieved, or even by the city itself. This would place every house, every business, and all the property of the city, at the uncontrolled will of the temporary local authorities. Yet this seems to have been the view taken by counsel who defended this case in the Circuit Court; for that single ordinance of the city, declaring the wharf of Yates a nuisance, and ordering its abatement, is the only evidence in the record that it is a nuisance or an obstruction to navigation, or in any manner injurious to the public.\nYates, 77 U.S. at 505; see also Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 140, 14 S. Ct. 499, 502 (1894) (\u201c[T]he legislature has no right arbitrarily to declare that to be a nuisance which is clearly not so.\u201d).\n\u00b6134 After 83 years of sanctioning alternative livestock ranching, it appears that the State has now decided that this activity is a noxious use of property. However, declaring it to be so does not retroactively make it so. The State may not escape paying just compensation for the Ranchers\u2019 losses through the mere expedient of declaring that which formerly was not a public nuisance to have been a public nuisance all along.\n3. Undertone about Alternative Livestock Ranchers\n\u00b6135 One final point must be made before concluding this discussion. There exists in the State\u2019s and the Sportsmen\u2019s briefs, and in the Court\u2019s Opinion as well, an undertone that alternative livestock ranchers are bad people who were engaged in an offensive business and deserved to be shut down. This undertone is not properly a part of the takings calculus. Montana has many businesses that strike some citizens as ill-advised or repugnant for one reason or another. Adult bookstores, strip clubs, bars, and casinos are obvious examples, though tobacco companies, insurance companies, oil companies, and power companies are also viewed by many with contempt. Though regulated, we tolerate the existence of businesses and activities that offend some segments of the population as the price for living in a free-market economy and an open society that values entrepreneurial activity. The fact that an individual\u2019s lawful business activity is offensive to some, however, does not itself negate the requirement that the State pay just compensation for taking that individual\u2019s property.\nD. Misplaced Reliance on Due Process Considerations\n\u00b6136 The foregoing discussion leads into the fourth and final preliminary matter: misplaced reliance on due process considerations. Broadly speaking, the issue we must decide on this appeal is whether the governmental action embodied in 1-143 amounted to a \u201ctaking\u201d of the Ranchers\u2019 property. In answering this question, relevant considerations include \u201cthe actual burden imposed on property rights\u201d and \u201chow that burden is allocated.\u201d Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 543, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2084 (2005). In contrast, whether 1-143 \u201csubstantially advances legitimate state interests\u201d or is \u201creasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose\u201d is irrelevant, since such considerations are pertinent to a due process analysis, not a takings analysis. See Lingle, 544 U.S. at 540-42, 125 S. Ct. at 2082-84.\n\u00b6137 Although the Sportsmen acknowledge that due process tests have \u201cno proper place\u201d in takings analysis, they embark on a lengthy discussion about the legitimacy of 1-143, arguing that it is \u201cvital\u201d to the protection of Montana\u2019s wildlife and to the tradition of fair-chase hunting. Indeed, the Sportsmen consume roughly a third of their appellate brief expounding on \u201cI-143\u2019s purposes and the importance of those purposes.\u201d The Sportsmen conclude that the \u201cweighty\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d purposes served by 1-143 \u201ctip the scales\u201d against the State\u2019s having to pay compensation for any diminution in the value of the Ranchers\u2019 property.\n\u00b6138 Similarly, the State acknowledges that due process precedents \u201care not especially helpful\u201d in resolving the Ranchers\u2019 takings claims. Nevertheless, the State contends that 1-143 is \u201ca valid police power regulation that substantially advances a number of important interests.\u201d Likewise, the District Court observed that 1-143 is \u201ca valid police power regulation that reasonably advances the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the State and its citizens\u201d and that \u201c[t]he State introduced unrebutted evidence that 1-143 advances substantial state interests.\u201d The District Court concluded that these factors \u201cweigh heavily against requiring the State to pay compensation here.\u201d\n\u00b6139 That the Sportsmen, the State, and the District Court have emphasized these sorts of considerations in their respective analyses is not surprising, given that the Supreme Court long analyzed takings claims under substantive due process principles. Such considerations, however, are not instructive of whether property has been taken; indeed, they are completely irrelevant. Thus, as the Ranchers correctly point out, it is improper (for purposes of analyzing their takings claims) to conduct a \u201cmeans-ends\u201d analysis of 1-143 and the District Court, therefore, erred in factoring due process considerations into its analysis. To understand why, it is helpful to begin with some historical background.\n1. Nineteenth Century Regulatory Takings\n\u00b6140 Contrary to the Court\u2019s assertion in \u00b6 67, the notion of a regulatory taking-where the government regulates private property rights, as opposed to condemning or directly appropriating private property-was recognized in this country long before 1922. Indeed, recognition of this sort of taking may be found in the 19th century decisions of numerous state courts and even the Supreme Court. See generally Kris W. Kobach, The Origins of Regulatory Takings: Setting the Record Straight, 1996 Utah L. Rev. 1211; Andrew S. Gold, Regulatory Takings and Original Intent: The Direct, Physical Takings Thesis \u201cGoes Too Far,\u201d 49 Am. U. L. Rev. 181, 228-38 (1999); Eric R. Claeys, Takings, Regulations, and Natural Property Rights, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 1549 (2003); David A. Thomas, Finding More Pieces for the Takings Puzzle: How Correcting History Can Clarify Doctrine, 75 U. Colo. L. Rev. 497, 519-33 (2004).\n\u00b6141 The Court insists that its contrary version of history is \u201cboth historically accurate and well-established.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 67 n. 8. Yet, tellingly, the Court fails to produce one single shred of historical authority to back up this claim. Rather, the Court merely cites the same demonstrably incorrect historical accounts that the scholars ably refute in their respective articles cited above. The Court apparently fails to recognize that \u201c[the Supreme] Court\u2019s opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the same way that [the Supreme Court\u2019s] interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.\u201d Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 106 n. 5, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 1148 n. 5 (1996) (Souter, Ginsburg, & Breyer, JJ., dissenting). Moreover, that the Supreme Court has \u201crepeated [a] mistake does not transform error into truth.\u201d Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 460, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2345 (2000) (Scalia & Thomas, JJ., dissenting). If the origins of regulatory takings doctrine is critical to the Court\u2019s analysis-and footnote 8 of the Opinion seems to suggest that it is-then it is curious that the Court would ignore authority which plainly refutes its statements in this regard. Not wanting to expend an inordinate amount of time on this point, I note just four of the cases here. Others are discussed in the articles cited above.\n\u00b6142 At issue in People v. Platt, 17 Johns. 195 (N.Y. Sup. 1819), were statutes that required the owners of dams on certain rivers to alter the dams so that salmon could pass freely over them. Platt, who owned a milldam across a nonnavigable river that flowed through his property, refused to make the required alterations. In considering the case, the court first observed that Platt had a \u201cright to the exclusive enjoyment of the river\u201d within the bounds of his property. Platt, 17 Johns, at 212. The court acknowledged that the legislature had the power to take property for public purposes, but the court reasoned that such appropriations \u201care constitutional, legal, and justifiable, only when a fair and just equivalent is awarded to the owner of property thus taken.\u201d Platt, 17 Johns, at 215. Here, the court observed, \u201cno equivalent is offered, or provided, for the loss which must inevitably ensue, upon a compliance with the requirements of the statutes.\u201d Platt, 17 Johns, at 215. Thus, because the statutes interfered with the usage rights associated with Platt\u2019s riparian property, the court held the statutes were void as applied to him, absent payment of compensation.\n\u00b6143 In Woodruff v. Neal, 28 Conn. 165 (1859), the defendant impounded the plaintiffs cow, which had been grazing along a public highway that passed through the defendant\u2019s land. The plaintiff claimed he had the right to depasture his cow along the highway by virtue of a government-issued license authorizing neat cattle to go at large. The court, however, observed that a highway is an easement conferring on the public only a right of passage and that the landowner retains the fee and \u201call rights of property\u201d in the land. Woodruff, 28 Conn, at 167. Among the retained rights, the court noted, was that of \u201cthe herbage of the land, which belongs exclusively to him, and having himself thus the right to depasture it, he may maintain trespass against any one who puts his cattle upon it to graze.\u201d Woodruff, 28 Conn, at 167. Accordingly, in the absence of compensation to the owner of the land upon which the plaintiffs license was to be exercised, the court held that granting the license was \u201cbeyond the constitutional power of the legislature.\u201d Woodruff, 28 Conn, at 169. Notably, a government-authorized permanent physical invasion of another\u2019s private property is now recognized as one of \u201ctwo categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S. Ct. at 2081 (citing Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking)).\n\u00b6144 Lastly, Walker v. Shepardson, 4 Wis. 486 (1855), and Yates v. Milwaukee, 77 U.S. 497 (1871), involved a wharf that extended from Yates\u2019s lot into the Milwaukee River. Under Wisconsin law, a riparian proprietor bounded by a navigable stream owned the land to the center of the stream, subject to a public easement to use the stream for navigation. See Walker, 4 Wis. at 508. Furthermore, he had \u201cthe right to use [his] land which is covered by the water of the river, in any way compatible with the use of the stream for the purposes of navigation,\u201d including constructing docks or landing places for goods or passengers. Walker, 4 Wis. at 508-09. The City of Milwaukee, however, established a dock line which, as it passed in front of Yates\u2019s lot, was 100 feet away from the navigable channel of the river. In other words, the City prohibited Yates from maintaining a dock over that part of his land between the dock line and the navigable part of the river, though a dock in this location would not have interfered with the public\u2019s easement. In so doing, the City rendered this section of his property worthless, and the court held that \u201cit would be necessary to make compensation to the owner for the property which would thus be rendered valueless by this act of the common council.\u201d Walker, 4 Wis. at 512; cf. Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S. Ct. at 2081 (a regulation that completely deprives an owner of \u201call economically beneficial use\u201d of her property is a per se taking (citing Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 2895 (1992))).\n\u00b6145 The City then declared Yates\u2019s wharf to be a nuisance and ordered its abatement. See Yates, 77 U.S. at 505. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which held that the mere declaration that Yates\u2019s wharf is a nuisance does not make it so. Yates, 77 U.S. at 505. More pertinent to the present discussion are the Supreme Court\u2019s statements respecting Yates\u2019s entitlement to compensation. In particular, the Court observed that among \u201cthe rights of a riparian proprietor whose land is bounded by a navigable stream\u201d are \u201caccess to the navigable part of the river from the front of his lot\u201d and \u201cthe right to make a landing, wharf or pier for his own use or for the use of the public.\u201d Yates, 77 U.S. at 504. This \u201criparian right,\u201d the Court observed,\nis property, and is valuable, and, though it must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights of the public, it cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed or impaired. It is a right of which, when once vested, the owner can only be deprived in accordance with established law, and if necessary that it be taken for the public good, upon due compensation.\nYates, 77 U.S. at 504. Thus, the Supreme Court held that if the City creates a dock line which \u201cdeprive[s] riparian owners of the right to avail themselves of the advantage of the navigable channel by building wharves and docks to it for that purpose,\u201d compensation is required. Yates, 77 U.S. at 505, 507. Notably, the following year, the Supreme Court reaffirmed \u201cthat a serious interruption to the common and necessary use of property may be ... equivalent to the taking of it, and that under the constitutional provisions it is not necessary that the land should be absolutely taken.\u201d Pumpelly v. Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Co., 80 U.S. 166, 179 (1872).\n\u00b6146 In sum, 19th century courts recognized what we now think of as \u201cregulatory takings\u201d of property, and the assertion that these are a \u201cmodern\u201d phenomenon (Opinion, \u00b6 67) is simply wrong. Indeed, none of the foregoing cases involved \u201cphysical invasion or outright appropriation\u201d by the government (Opinion, \u00b6 67).\n\u00b6147 As an aside, it is interesting that the \u201cbundle-of-sticks\u201d conception of property-i.e., the view that \u201cproperty\u201d is a bundle of discrete rights associated with a thing, such as the rights of usage, exclusion, alienation, access, and alteration-was frequently seen in the cases of this period. See Kobach, 1996 Utah L. Rev. at 1236, 1252. Each discrete right was protected to the same degree as the next. Moreover, in determining whether a state action constituted a compensable taking, courts which adhered to this conception of property, \u201cimposed neither a threshold dollar value for the total injury nor a minimum percentage by which the entire property had to be devalued. Instead, a much simpler rule seemed to underlie their opinions: if any discrete stick in the bundle was taken, compensation was required.\u201d Kobach, 1996 Utah L. Rev. at 1252.\n2. The Supreme Court\u2019s Substantive Due Process Approach\n\u00b6148 As touched on in the discussion of police power/noxious use theory above, the Supreme Court during the last quarter of the 19th century analyzed regulatory takings claims against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. See Bradley C. Karkkainen, The Police Power Revisited: Phantom Incorporation and the Roots of the Takings \u201cMuddle,\u201d 90 Minn. L. Rev. 826, 847-50 (2006); see also Kobach, 1996 Utah L. Rev. at 1276-85 (explaining that in Railroad Co. v. Richmond, 96 U.S. 521 (1878), Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U.S. 635 (1879), Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 8 S. Ct. 273 (1887), and Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U.S. 141, 21 S. Ct. 48 (1900), the Supreme Court \u201cretreated\u201d from the takings doctrine it had enunciated in Yates and Pumpelly). The analysis turned centrally on whether the challenged regulation fell within the legitimate bounds of the state\u2019s police power, since that power was viewed as an inherent limitation on state-law property rights. In other words, if the regulation was a legitimate exercise of the police power, no compensation was required for the simple reason that no deprivation of property had occurred. See Karkkainen, 90 Minn. L. Rev. at 830-31, 838-42; see also e.g. Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, 683-87, 8 S. Ct. 992, 995-97 (1888); Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Chicago (\u201cChicago, B & <?\u201d), 166 U.S. 226, 252, 17 S. Ct. 581, 590-91 (1897). The Court followed this approach well into the 20th century. ***&See e.g. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, 232 U.S. 548, 558-59, 34 S. Ct. 364, 368 (1914); New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. New Orleans, 281 U.S. 682, 687, 50 S. Ct. 449, 450 (1930); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 592, 82 S. Ct. 987, 989 (1962); but see Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160 (1922) (\u201cWhen this seemingly absolute protection [of private property] is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d).\n\u00b6 149 The line which separated legitimate from illegitimate exercises of the police power, in turn, hinged on the following: whether the regulation was in some way designed to promote the health, safety, or welfare of the community; whether the means employed had a real and substantial relation to the avowed or ostensible purpose of the regulation; and whether the interference with private rights was not wanton or arbitrary. See e.g. Mugler, 123 U.S. at 661, 8 S. Ct. at 297; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 137, 14 S. Ct. 499, 501 (1894); Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U.S. 223, 238-39, 25 S. Ct. 18, 21 (1904); St. Louis, Iron Mt. & S. Ry. Co. v. Wynne, 224 U.S. 354, 359-60, 32 S. Ct. 493, 494 (1912); Atlantic Coast Line, 232 U.S. at 559, 34 S. Ct. at 368; Reinman v. Little Rock, 237 U.S. 171, 176-77, 35 S. Ct. 511, 513 (1915); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394, 410, 36 S. Ct. 143, 145 (1915); Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 212 U.S. 365, 387, 395, 47 S. Ct. 114, 118, 121 (1926); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272, 279-80, 48 S. Ct. 246, 247-48 (1928); Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188, 48 S. Ct. 447, 448 (1928); Goldblatt, 369 U.S. at 594-95, 82 S. Ct. at 990.\n3. Penn Central\u2019s Conflation of Doctrines\n\u00b6150 Meanwhile, during this same period, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause operated as a parallel and similar, but nonetheless distinct and independent strand of constitutional doctrine, with its own canonical precedents. See Karkkainen, 90 Minn. L. Rev. at 855-61 (and cases discussed therein). In Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978), however, the Supreme Court collapsed its substantive due process and takings precedents into a single Fifth Amendment regulatory takings test applicable to both state and federal actions, thereby creating a \u201cmuddle.\u201d See John D. Echeverria & Sharon Dennis, The Takings Issue and the Due Process Clause:A Way Out of a Doctrinal Confusion, 17 Vt. L. Rev. 695, 695-703 (1993). The Court articulated a number of factors that it considered pertinent under this test, including the economic impact of the regulation on the property owner, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations, the character of the governmental action, and whether the regulation has an unduly harsh impact upon the owner\u2019s use of the property. Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 127, 98 S. Ct. at 2659, 2660-61. In addition, the Court retained the fundamental precepts of substantive due process doctrine. See Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 125-27, 98 S. Ct. at 2659-61 (discussing or citing, among others, Nectow, Euclid, Miller, Hadacheck, Reinman, Mugler, and Goldblatt). In particular, the Court reaffirmed that \u201ca use restriction on real property may constitute a \u2018taking\u2019 if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 127, 98 S. Ct. at 2660. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the regulation at issue (New York City\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Law) had not effected a taking of the appellants\u2019 property because \u201c[t]he restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 138, 98 S. Ct. at 2666.\n\u00b6151 As a conflation of substantive due process and takings doctrines, the Penn Central inquiry necessarily reflected elements of both. Two years later, in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 100 S. Ct. 2138 (1980), the Supreme Court summarized the takings inquiry as follows: \u201cThe application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.\u201d Agins, 447 U.S. at 260, 100 S. Ct. at 2141 (citing Nectow, 277 U.S. at 188, 48 S. Ct. at 448, and Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 138 n. 36, 98 S. Ct. at 2666 n. 36). The \u201csubstantially advances\u201d prong of this test was repeated in numerous subsequent cases, see Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 704, 119 S. Ct. 1624, 1636 (1999) (citing cases), and remained in place for the next 25 years.\n4. Lingle\u2019s Clarifications\n\u00b6152 In Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 125 S. Ct. 2074 (2005), the Supreme Court jettisoned the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d formulation. The Court observed that the Takings Clause was designed not to limit governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking. Lingle, 544 U.S. at 537, 125 S. Ct. at 2080. With respect to regulatory takings, the Court framed the dispositive question as whether the regulation is \u201cso onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 537, 125 S. Ct. at 2081. To answer this question, the Court explained, courts must focus on \u201cthe severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082.\n\u00b6153 The \u201csubstantially advances\u201d formula, however, suggests a means-ends test: It asks, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose. Lingle, 544 U.S. at 542, 125 S. Ct. at 2083. Of course, this is the due process inquiry the Court had long applied when analyzing regulatory takings claims against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Lingle, however, the Court made clear that this sort of inquiry is ineffective for discerning whether private property has been \u201ctaken\u201d for purposes of the Fifth Amendment:\n[T]he \u201csubstantially advances\u201d inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights. Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners. In consequence, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.\nInstead of addressing a challenged regulation\u2019s effect on private property, the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d inquiry probes the regulation\u2019s underlying validity. But such an inquiry is logically prior to and distinct from the question whether a regulation effects a taking, for the Takings Clause presupposes that the government has acted in pursuit of a valid public purpose. The Clause expressly requires compensation where government takes private property \u201cfor public use.\u201d It does not bar government from interfering with property rights, but rather requires compensation \u201cin the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.\u201d Conversely, if a government action is found to be impermissible-for instance because it fails to meet the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement or is so arbitrary as to violate due process-that is the end of the inquiry. No amount of compensation can authorize such action.\nLingle, 544 U.S. at 542-43, 125 S. Ct. at 2084 (citation omitted).\n\u00b6154 Lingle, therefore, is an important clarification of federal regulatory takings law. The critical focus in a regulatory takings case is on the severity of the burden a particular regulation imposes on private property rights and how that regulatory burden is distributed among property owners. The due process and means-ends considerations that had informed the Court\u2019s prior decisions are no longer appropriate measures of whether a taking has occurred.\n\u00b6155 It is also important to note here that in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that a valid police power regulation never requires compensation to the owner. The Court observed that there are \u201climits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power.\u201d Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1026, 112 S. Ct. at 2899. Otherwise, if \u201cthe uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, \u2018the natural tendency of human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappeared].\u2019 \u201d Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1014, 112 S. Ct. at 2892-93 (brackets in Lucas) (quoting Mahon, 260 U.S. at 415, 43 S. Ct. at 160).\n5. Conclusion\n\u00b6156 The due process considerations pervading the District Court\u2019s decision and the Sportsmen\u2019s and the State\u2019s respective arguments maybe understood in light of the many Supreme Court precedents which analyze regulatory takings claims using due process principles. However, such considerations are misplaced in light of Lingle. The Ranchers are not precluded from recovering for a constitutional taking simply because the State was exercising its police powers, or because I-143 substantially advances legitimate state interests. Indeed, we assume going into the takings analysis that the governmental actions embodied in 1-143 are valid, and the central question we address is whether 1-143 is \u201cso onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.\u201d See Lingle, 544 U.S. at 537, 543, 125 S. Ct. at 2081, 2084.\nIII. ANALYSIS OF THE RANCHERS\u2019 TAKINGS CLAIMS\nA. The Basis of the Ranchers\u2019 Claims\n\u00b6157 The Ranchers filed this action against the State, and the Sportsmen intervened as defendants a month later. The Ranchers challenged 1-143 on various grounds, including due process and equal protection, and they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In the alternative, if 1-143 were found to be constitutional and enforceable against them, the Ranchers sought just compensation for a regulatory taking of their property. The Ranchers, in other words, brought an \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d action.\n\u00b6158 The phrase \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d is a shorthand description of the manner in which a property owner recovers just compensation for a taking of his property when condemnation proceedings have not been instituted. United States v. Clarke, 445 U.S. 253, 257, 100 S. Ct. 1127, 1130 (1980). Whereas a condemnation proceeding typically involves an action by the condemnor to acquire title to property, inverse condemnation is an action by the property owner against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property that has been taken, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by the government. See Clarke, 445 U.S. at 257, 100 S. Ct. at 1130; see also First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County, 482 U.S. 304, 316, 107 S. Ct. 2378, 2386 (1987) (\u2018While the typical taking occurs when the government acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the entire doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the proposition that a taking may occur without such formal proceedings.\u201d). Thus, \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d describes an action that is the \u201cinverse\u201d or \u201creverse\u201d of a condemnation proceeding. Clarke, 445 U.S. at 257, 100 S. Ct. at 1130. \u201cThe owner\u2019s right to bring such a suit derives from the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to condemnation.\u201d Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. United States, 467 U.S. 1, 5 n. 6, 104 S. Ct. 2187, 2191 n. 6 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00b6159 Here, the State did not condemn the Ranchers\u2019 property through a formal proceeding; rather, the State regulated their property through passage of 1-143. As a result, the Ranchers brought an inverse condemnation action to recover for their losses caused by the Initiative. See Southview Assoc. v. Bongartz, 980 F.2d 84, 93 n. 3 (2d Cir. 1992) (\u201cEssentially, a regulatory taking \u2014 also known as inverse condemnation-occurs when the purpose of government regulation and its economic effect on the property owner render the regulation substantively equivalent to an eminent domain proceeding and, therefore, require the government to pay compensation to the property owner.\u201d); Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain vol. 2A, \u00a7 6.03[1], 6-182 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2006) (\u201c[S]ome regulatory or other activities may effect a taking, necessitating that owners bring inverse condemnation proceedings against the government.\u201d).\nB. The Constitutional Basis for Our Decision\n\u00b6160 The Ranchers seek relief under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution. Yet, while the Court\u2019s decision purports to rest on both of these provisions, see Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 54, 63, 65, and while the Court acknowledges that the plain language of the two provisions differs, Opinion, \u00b6 30-indeed, the language of Article II, Section 29 is facially broader than the language of the Fifth Amendment-the Court nevertheless offers no independent interpretation of Article II, Section 29. Quite to the contrary, the Court decides to follow \u201cour previous approach of looking towards federal jurisprudence when considering takings claims under Montana law.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 31. In so doing, the Court equates the Ranchers\u2019 claims under the Fifth Amendment with the Ranchers\u2019 claims under Article II, Section 29.\n\u00b6161 The Court offers a singularly unpersuasive explanation for this approach: \u201c[The Ranchers] rely almost exclusively on federal case law.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 31. That, however, is hardly a justification for treating a claim brought under a facially broader provision of the Montana Constitution as no different from a claim brought under the provision\u2019s counterpart in the United States Constitution. Moreover, if it seems that the Ranchers are relying \u201calmost exclusively\u201d on federal caselaw, it is because there is very little, if any, Montana caselaw on point. And this jurisprudential void is not likely to be filled when this Court persists in the utterly circular and self-perpetuating syllogism: because this Court in the past has looked to federal caselaw for guidance when considering takings claims, the Ranchers have relied on federal caselaw in support of their position, and because the Ranchers have relied on federal caselaw in support of their position, we will look to federal caselaw in considering their takings claims.\n\u00b6162 Of course, \u201c[i]t is perfectly proper for us to use criteria developed in federal cases\u201d when state law is silent or lacking. Pfost v. State, 219 Mont. 206, 216, 713 P.2d 495, 501 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Meech v. Hillhaven West, Inc., 238 Mont. 21, 26, 776 P.2d 488, 491 (1989). It is also proper for us to rely on federal jurisprudence as persuasive authority. But there is a vast difference between looking to federal law for guidance and allowing federal-court decisions to dictate the meaning and substance of Montana\u2019s Constitution. Unfortunately, in the case at hand, the Court has done the latter by conflating the Ranchers\u2019 federal and state constitutional claims into one.\n\u00b6163 It would be one thing if the Court simply refused to reach the Ranchers\u2019 claims under Article II, Section 29 on the ground that they had failed to raise it adequately. See e.g. State v. Garrymore, 2006 MT 245, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 334 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 145 P.3d 946, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39 (concluding that Garrymore\u2019s argument under Article II, Sections 24 and 26 was \u201ctoo undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles\u201d); State v. Rosling, 2008 MT 62, \u00b6 66, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 66, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 66 (same). But that is not what the Court does. Rather, notwithstanding the Ranchers\u2019 reliance \u201calmost exclusively\u201d on federal caselaw and the Ranchers\u2019 corresponding failure to develop their theory of relief under the Montana Constitution to the Court\u2019s satisfaction-the exact situation we faced in Garrymore and Rosling-the Court proceeds to issue a decision that likewise relies almost exclusively on Fifth Amendment cases but is grounded, in part, on Article II, Section 29. This equating of the two constitutional provisions is regrettable, not only because it denigrates our own Constitution and renders Article II, Section 29 little more than a constitutional redundancy, but also because it is totally unnecessary. If the Ranchers are to be faulted for failing to cite precedents under Article II, Section 29 to the Court\u2019s satisfaction, then their claims should be resolved under M. R. App. P. 12(l)f., not by conflating their federal and state constitutional claims into one.\n\u00b6164 According to the State, the Ranchers \u201cconceded in the court below that the reach of the Taking Clause under the Fifth Amendment and the protection from uncompensated takings found in Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution are co-extensive.\u201d As support for this assertion, the State directs us to the following statement by the Ranchers in one of their District Court filings: \u201cThe Montana Supreme Court is generally in accord with federal case law on the analysis of takings.\u201d (The Court refers to this statement as well. See Opinion, \u00b6 31.) This, however, is hardly the concession the State makes it out to be. The Ranchers did not \u201cconcede\u201d that the protections of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 are \u201cco-extensive.\u201d They merely offered a candid acknowledgement of this Court\u2019s past approach, which is to \u201clook[ ] towards federal jurisprudence when considering takings claims under Montana law\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 31). More importantly, this supposed concession that the protections of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 are \u201cco-extensive\u201d does not establish that they are so. This Court, not the Ranchers, determines the \u201creach\u201d of Article II, Section 29.\n\u00b6165 We have recognized that the provisions of Article II are \u201cseparate and enforceable constitutional rights insofar as the jurisdiction of the State of Montana extends.\u201d Madison v. Yunker, 180 Mont. 54, 60, 589 P.2d 126, 129 (1978). We have also said that \u201cwe will not reach a federal constitutional challenge unless and until the case may not be resolved on adequate and independent state grounds.\u201d Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp., 224 Mont. 318, 325, 730 P.2d 380, 384 (1986). Along these same lines, we have stated that where the constitutionality of a governmental act affecting property rights is attacked under both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution, \u201cwe believe it to be our duty, irrespective of the holdings of other courts, to consider and apply the provisions of our own Constitution and general statutes thereto, and declare the rule of property for Montana.\u201d Gas Products Co. v. Rankin, 63 Mont. 372, 388, 207 P. 993, 997-98 (1922). Finally, when interpreting provisions of Article II, we have long refused to march lockstep with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements concerning similar provisions of the federal constitution.\n\u00b6166 For these reasons, our approach in this case should be to address the Ranchers\u2019 claims first under the Montana Constitution and then, if necessary, under the United States Constitution. The Court\u2019s decision, however, is based entirely on Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. Moreover, although the Ranchers cite Article II, Section 29 as a basis for relief, their corresponding argument is largely undeveloped. Cf. Garrymore, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Rosling, \u00b6 66. Accordingly, I will analyze the Ranchers\u2019 claims under the Fifth Amendment, rather than Article II, Section 29. In so doing, I will also explain my disagreement with the Court\u2019s corresponding Fifth Amendment analysis. As for Article II, Section 29, the claim that 1-143 effected a taking or damaging of property under the Montana Constitution is better developed by the appellants in the companion case, Buhmann v. State (No. 05-473). Therefore, I will address Article II, Section 29 within the context of that case and explain why that provision entitles the Buhmann appellants to just compensation.\nC. Analytical Framework and Relevant Principles under the Fifth Amendment\n\u00b6167 The Fifth Amendment states: \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. In analyzing a takings claim in the context of an inverse condemnation action, the court first determines whether the plaintiff possesses a constitutionally protected property interest. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1000, 104 S. Ct. 2862, 2871 (1984); Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, 525 F.3d 1370, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Whether one has a protected property interest is a question of law. See Texas State Bank v. United States, 423 F.3d 1370, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005). If the plaintiff possesses a protected property interest, the court then determines whether a part or a whole of that interest has been taken for public use, thus entitling the plaintiff to just compensation. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1000-01, 104 S. Ct. at 2871; Members of Peanut Quota Holders Ass\u2019n v. United States, 421 F.3d 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The issue of whether a taking has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings. Huntleigh, 525 F.3d at 1377.\n\u00b6168 With respect to the first question (whether the plaintiff possesses a constitutionally protected property interest), the Constitution protects, but does not create, property interests. Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 164, 118 S. Ct. 1925, 1930 (1998). Rather, property interests \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1001, 104 S. Ct. at 2872 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Phillips, 524 U.S. at 164, 118 S. Ct. at 1930. In this regard, the term \u201cproperty,\u201d as used in the Takings Clause, is not restricted to any particular type of property. To the contrary, it encompasses a wide variety of interests. Clearly, it includes real property, personal property, and intangible property. Huntleigh, 525 F.3d at 1377-78. But it also \u201c denote[s] the group of rights inhering in the citizen\u2019s relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of it.\u2019 \u201d PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 82 n. 6, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 2041 n. 6 (1980) (brackets in PruneYard) (quoting United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 378, 65 S. Ct. 357, 359 (1945)). Property interests \u201care about as diverse as the human mind can conceive,\u201d Florida Rock Industries v. United States, 18 F.3d 1560, 1572 n. 32 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and the Takings Clause is addressed to \u201cevery sort of interest the citizen may possess,\u201d General Motors, 323 U.S. at 378, 65 S. Ct. at 359.\n\u00b6169 With respect to the second question (whether a part or a whole of the plaintiffs property interest has been taken for public use), the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents stake out two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes: first, where the government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property, and second, where a regulation completely deprives an owner of all economically beneficial uses of her property. See Lingle v. Chevron U.S. A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 538, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2081 (2005) (citing, respectively, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982), and Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992)). Outside these two relatively narrow categories (and the special context of land-use exactions, which are not at issue here), regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards set forth in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978). See Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S. Ct. at 2081.\n\u00b6170 The case at hand does not involve a Loretto-type \u201cpermanent physical invasion\u201d claim, but the Ranchers do make several assertions that could be construed as a Lucas-type \u201ctotal regulatory taking\u201d claim. For instance, the Kafkas assert that after 1-143, there was \u201cno economically viable use\u201d of their alternative livestock and that the fair market value of their licenses and businesses \u201cwent to zero.\u201d Likewise, citing Lucas, the Bridgewaters and the Boumas assert that passage of I-143 \u201cdestroyed the beneficial use\u201d of their property and \u201ceffectively left it economically idle.\u201d The Court also perceives a Lucas-based theory in the Ranchers\u2019 arguments, noting that \u201cAppellants urge us to... correctly apply the Penn Central or Lucas takings analysis.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36.\n\u00b6171 At the same time, however, the Kafkas make the dubious pronouncement that \u201cLucas analysis applies to categorical takings of land, not regulatory takings of other property interests.\u201d In an unexpected twist, the State counters that \u201c[w]hile Lucas on its facts involved a claimed categorical taking of land, the principles explained by the court in its opinion govern in other regulatory taking contexts as well, as exemplified by [American Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, 379 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2004)].\u201d Yet, according to the Kafkas, application of Lucas to their regulatory takings claim would be \u201cmisguided and erroneous.\u201d They contend that \u201cwhether the regulation at issue has denied the claimant of the economically viable use of its property\u2019 is to be examined under the economic-impact prong of the Penn Central test. The Bridgewaters and the Boumas do not go so far as to' reject a Lucas-based theory outright, but they, like the Kafkas, tie their Lucas arguments to their Penn Central analysis. Accordingly, given the lack of a distinct Lacas-based analysis in the Ranchers\u2019 briefs, and given that their Fifth Amendment arguments track the analytical approach set forth in Penn Central, I likewise will address their regulatory takings challenge under Penn Central\u2019s standards.\n\u00b6172 Two fundamental principles underlie the Supreme Court\u2019s regulatory takings jurisprudence. The first is Justice Holmes\u2019 proposition that \u201cwhile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\u201d Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160 (1922). The second is Justice Black\u2019s articulation of the purpose of the Takings Clause: \u201cThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563, 1569 (1960). These two principles are cited time and again in the Supreme Court\u2019s contemporary takings cases.\n\u00b6173 The Supreme Court has been \u201cunable to develop any \u2018set formula\u2019 for determining when \u2018justice and fairness\u2019 require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659; accord Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S. Ct. at 2081. Indeed, except for the two per se categories identified above (permanent physical invasion, and complete deprivation of all economically beneficial use), the Court has \u201c \u2018generally eschewed\u2019 any set formula for determining how far is too far, choosing instead to engage in \u2018 \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 326, 122 S. Ct. 1465, 1481 (2002) (quoting Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S. Ct. at 2893, in turn quoting Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659).\n\u00b6174 Nevertheless, in Penn Central, the Supreme Court identified \u201cseveral factors that have particular significance\u201d in conducting these \u201cad hoc, factual inquiries.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659. The factors include \u201c[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,\u201d \u201cthe extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations,\u201d and \u201cthe character of the governmental action.\u201d Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Penn Central test in Lingle. See Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538-39, 548, 125 S. Ct. at 2081-82, 2087.\n\u00b6175 In applying these factors, we must remain cognizant of the object of this exercise. Thus, it is useful to reiterate some of the clarifications made by the Supreme Court in Lingle and discussed in Part II-D-4 of this Dissent. In particular, the ultimate question in a Fifth Amendment regulatory takings analysis is whether the regulation is \u201cso onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 537, 125 S. Ct. at 2081. To answer this question, each of the Supreme Court\u2019s regulatory takings tests \u201cfocuses directly upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082; see also Lingle, 544 U.S. at 542, 125 S. Ct. at 2084 (emphasizing \u201cthe magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights\u201d). For example, a permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails, must be compensated because it \u201ceviscerates the owner\u2019s right to exclude others from entering and using her property \u2014 perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082. In the Lucas context, compensation is required for the complete elimination of a property\u2019s value because \u201c \u2018total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner\u2019s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation.\u2019 \u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539-40, 125 S. Ct. at 2082 (quoting Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1017, 112 S. Ct. at 2894). And the Penn Central inquiry \u201cturns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation\u2019s economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 540, 125 S. Ct. at 2082.\n\u00b6176 With this framework in mind, I proceed with a Fifth Amendment analysis of the Ranchers\u2019 takings claims.\nD. Analysis of the Ranchers\u2019 Claims under the Fifth\nAmendment\n\u00b6177 The Court divides the Ranchers\u2019 assets into four categories: alternative livestock ranch licenses, intangible business assets, real estate interests and fixtures, and alternative livestock. The Court explains that \u201c[i]n cases where there is a \u2018mix\u2019 of property interests, it is appropriate, if warranted under the circumstances, to consider those interests separately in a takings analysis.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. Apparently, separate consideration of property interests is \u201cwarranted\u201d in this case because \u201c[t]hat was the approach applied by the District Court.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. I question whether this is a legally authoritative rationale for the Court\u2019s approach. But, for the sake of argument, and because it facilitates a comparison between the Court\u2019s reasoning and my own, I will consider each of the Ranchers\u2019 assets under the categories proffered by the Court.\n1. The Alternative Livestock Ranch Licenses\n\u00b6178 At the outset of discussing the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock ranch licenses, it must be pointed out that the Court\u2019s discussion at \u00b6\u00b6 38-54 is largely off point. These paragraphs are dedicated to the question of whether a \u201cgovernment-issued license\u201d is a compensable property interest. The Court ultimately answers this question in the negative, at least as far as the Ranchers\u2019 licenses are concerned. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Yet, 1-143 did not revoke the Ranchers\u2019 licenses. Indeed, the Ranchers still possess and use their licenses, and they may continue to do so, so long as they pay the annual renewal fee, comply with all recording and reporting requirements, and do not engage in misconduct in operating their ranches. Sections 87-4-412(1), -423(1), -427(1), MCA (2001).\n\u00b6179 Thus, since the Ranchers still have their licenses, they obviously are not claiming that 1-143 took the licenses themselves. What the Ranchers claim, rather, is that 1-143 took a particular property interest associated with the licenses-namely, the right to transfer them and, more generally, their businesses. See Laws of Montana 2001, 2000 Ballot Issues, Initiative No. 143, \u00a7 4 (amending \u00a7 87-4-412(2), MCA); \u00a7 87-4-412(2), MCA (2001) (\u201cAn alternative livestock ranch license for a specific facility is not transferable.\u201d). There can be no doubt that the right to transfer is a compensable property interest. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 500,107 S. Ct. 1232, 1250 (1987) (\u201c[T]he right to sell property [is] ... one element of the owner\u2019s property interest.\u201d); Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65-66, 100 S. Ct. 318, 327 (1979) (labeling the right to dispose of property-e.g., through commercial transactions \u2014 as \u201cone traditional property right\u201d and one \u201cstrand\u201d of the \u201cbundle\u201d of property rights an owner possesses); Conti v. United States, 291 F.3d 1334, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cThe rights to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer are traditional hallmarks of property.\u201d); Thompson v. Lincoln Nat. Life Ins. Co., 114 Mont. 521, 533, 138 P.2d 951, 957 (1943) (\u201c[A]n essential element of the right of private property is the right to use or dispose of it....\u201d); \u00a7 70-1-503, MCA (\u201cProperty of any kind may be transferred,....\u201d).\n\u00b6180 1-143 abrogated the Ranchers\u2019 ability to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their businesses by amending \u00a7 87-4-412(2), MCA, to prohibit the transfer of their alternative livestock ranch licenses. Accordingly, the actual question here is whether this revocation of the right to transfer constitutes a taking under the Penn Central inquiry \u2014 an issue the Court conveniently sidesteps by rewriting the Ranchers\u2019 claim to be one based on loss of the licenses themselves, rather than loss of the right to transfer the licenses.\n\u00b6181 In answering this question, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 107 S. Ct. 2076 (1987), provides useful guidance. At issue in Irving was a regulation requiring certain undivided fractional interests in Indian lands to escheat to the tribe. In conducting its Penn Central inquiry, the Supreme Court first concluded that the economic impact of this regulation \u201ccan be substantial,\u201d given the value of the underlying lands. Irving, 481 U.S. at 714, 107 S. Ct. at 2082. Furthermore, the Court observed that \u201cthe right to pass on valuable property to one\u2019s heirs is itself a valuable right.\u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 715, 107 S. Ct. at 2082-83. Thus, even though the owners of the escheatable interests had full beneficial use of their property during their lifetimes, they had lost a valuable right associated with those interests. On the other hand, while some of the owners may have purchased their interests with the expectation that they might pass on the remainder to their heirs at death, most of them had acquired their interests by gift, descent, or devise. Thus, the extent to which they had investment-backed expectations in passing on the property was \u201cdubious.\u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 715, 107 S. Ct. at 2083. Also weighing \u201cweakly\u201d in favor of the statute was the \u201caverage reciprocity of advantage\u201d \u2014 i.e., the fact that consolidation of Indian lands in the tribe benefitted the members of the tribe. Irving, 481 U.S. at 715-16, 107 S. Ct. at 2083 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00b6182 At this point, the Supreme Court noted that if it were to stop its analysis based on the foregoing considerations, \u201cwe might well find [the regulation] constitutional. But the character of the Government regulation here is extraordinary.\u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 716, 107 S. Ct. at 2083. With reasoning that is pertinent to the Ranchers\u2019 loss of transferability, the Court explained:\nIn Kaiser Aetna v. United States, [444 U.S. 164, 176, 100 S. Ct. 383, 391 (1979)], we emphasized that the regulation destroyed \u201cone of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property-the right to exclude others.\u201d Similarly, the regulation here amounts to virtually the abrogation of the right to pass on a certain type of property-the small undivided interest-to one\u2019s heirs. In one form or another, the right to pass on property-to one\u2019s family in particular-has been part of the Anglo-American legal system since feudal times.... Even the United States concedes that total abrogation of the right to pass property is unprecedented and likely unconstitutional.... Since the escheatable interests are not, as the United States argues, necessarily de minimis, nor, as it also argues, does the availability of inter vivos transfer obviate the need for descent and devise, a total abrogation of these rights cannot be upheld.\nIrving, 481 U.S. at 716-17, 107 S. Ct. at 2083-84.\n\u00b6183 Thus, the Supreme Court held that the escheat regulation \u201c \u2018goes too far.\u2019 \u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 718, 107 S. Ct. at 2084 (quoting Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160 (1922)). The Court acknowledged the government\u2019s \u201cbroad authority to adjust the rules governing the descent and devise of property without implicating the guarantees of the Just Compensation Clause.\u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 717, 107 S. Ct. at 2084. \u201cThe difference in this case,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cis the fact that both descent and devise are completely abolished.\u201d Irving, 481 U.S. at 717, 107 S. Ct. at 2084.\n\u00b6184 Similarly, in the case at hand, the character of the government regulation is extraordinary. 1-143 abolished one of the traditional hallmarks of property: the right to transfer. The economic impact of this total abrogation is substantial, given that an alternative livestock ranch license is an integral component of an alternative livestock business. No longer may the Ranchers sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their businesses. In this connection, the Bridgewaters point out that prior to the passage of 1-143, they received an offer of $4 million to buy their operation. Following passage, however, the offer was withdrawn, in large part because the license could not be transferred. Under Irving, these factors alone dictate that the Ranchers\u2019 right to transfer has been taken.\n\u00b6185 Notably, the State might have precluded this issue from arising had it continued to prohibit the transfer of alternative livestock ranch licenses. In that scenario, a participant in the industry would have been hard-pressed to claim an investment-backed expectation in being able to transfer her license and business. But in 1993, the Legislature granted the right to transfer the licenses. See Laws of Montana 1993, ch. 315, \u00a7 6 (substituting \u201c[a] game farm license for a specific facility is transferable\u201d for \u201c[a] game farm license is nontransferable\u201d in \u00a7 87-4-412, MCA, effective April 12,1993). The Bridgewaters entered into the alternative livestock business in 1992 and thereafter invested in improvements uniquely designed for operating an alternative livestock business on their property. The Kafkas and the Boumas began investing in their respective operations in 1996. All of the Ranchers had reasonable expectations that they would be able to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their businesses. These investment-backed expectations bolster the conclusion that the Ranchers have suffered a taking.\n\u00b6186 Before concluding this discussion, I pause to address several facets of the Court\u2019s approach. Although I consider the Court\u2019s analysis at \u00b6\u00b6 38-54 to be largely off point, I believe there are fundamental flaws in that analysis and that it is important to point those out, given the deleterious impact they will have on future takings cases.\n\u00b6187 As noted, the Court addresses the question of whether the alternative livestock ranch licenses themselves are compensable property interests. The Supreme Court has said that for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, \u201c[property interests] are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1001, 104 S. Ct. 2862, 2872 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in Monsanto, the Supreme Court looked to Missouri law to determine whether Monsanto\u2019s trade secrets constituted \u201cproperty.\u201d See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1001-04, 104 S. Ct. at 2872-73. In so doing, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cintangible property rights protected by state law are deserving of the protection of the Taking Clause.\u201d Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003, 104 S. Ct. at 2873. Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that \u201cto the extent that Monsanto has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade-secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04, 104 S. Ct. at 2873.\n\u00b6188 In light of this approach, one would expect the Court, in the case at hand, to look to Montana law to determine whether the Ranchers\u2019 licenses constitute \u201cproperty.\u201d But that is not what the Court does. Rather, the Court allows the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to dictate whether a license granted by the State of Montana is protected \u201cproperty.\u201d See Opinion, \u00b6 46 (\u201cAs stated in [Members of Peanut Quota Holders Ass\u2019n v. United States, 421 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2005)], to qualify as compensable property interests, the Licenses must be transferable, exclusive, and free of any \u2018express statutory language precluding the formation of a property right ....\u2019 Members, 421 F.3d at 1331. We address each of these requirements in turn, as they apply to the Licenses before us.\u201d (ellipsis in original)); Opinion, \u00b6 54 (\u201cAccordingly, because the Licenses did not meet the three required criteria for compensability under Members, we conclude the District Court did not err when it held the Licenses were not compensable property interests under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, or Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d). I do not dispute the validity of the Federal Circuit\u2019s test vis-a-vis federally created property interests. Indeed, all of the cases from which the Federal Circuit synthesized its test involved licenses or permits granted by the federal government. See Members, 421 F.3d at 1330-31. But why should the Federal Circuit\u2019s test define what constitutes a compensable property interest under Montana law? The Court offers no explanation, and I can conceive of no valid reason-particularly when Montana law does provide the answer.\n\u00b6189 As explained in Part II-A of this Dissent, the \u201cexisting rules or understandings\u201d related to the Ranchers\u2019 licenses, prior to 1-143, were as follows. First, as the State acknowledged during oral argument, \u201cit was the policy of the political branches of government to encourage people to look at game farming as an alternative to traditional agriculture-actually, to subsidize traditional agriculture so they could stay on the farms and ranches.\u201d See \u00a7 87-4-431, MCA (1999) (\u201cThe legislature recognizes that the production of alternative livestock provides a viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.\u201d). The licenses were issued and annually renewed in facilitation of this \u201cviable economic opportunity.\u201d Second, renewal of the licenses was a matter of right, upon payment of the renewal fee and compliance with all recording and reporting requirements. Section 87-4-412(1), MCA. Third, the license could not be revoked except if the licensee had violated the law or otherwise engaged in misconduct related to the operation of the alternative livestock ranch. Sections 87-4-423(1), -427(1), MCA. Fourth, the license was transferable. Section 87-4-412(2), MCA.\n\u00b6190 Given these rules and understandings, it is clear that the Ranchers\u2019 licenses had several traditional hallmarks of property, including \u201cthe right to possess, use and dispose of [them].\u201d PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 82 n. 6, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 2041 n. 6 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ranchers could-and did-use their licenses in the furtherance of their businesses. The Ranchers could sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their licenses. The Ranchers had statutorily guaranteed security in the continued possession of their licenses and, correspondingly, their ability to pursue this \u201cviable economic opportunity.\u201d It seems patently obvious to me that in their alternative livestock ranch licenses, the Ranchers had property rights which were protected by Montana law and, as such, are deserving of protection under the Takings Clause. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04, 104 S. Ct. at 2873.\n\u00b6191 Additional \u201cbackground principles\u201d of Montana property law further support the conclusion that the Ranchers\u2019 licenses are \u201cproperty\u201d for Takings Clause purposes. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1030, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 2901 (1992). For one thing, the Montana Code contains a provision actually categorizing \u201clicenses\u201d as \u201cproperty.\u201d See \u00a7 15-6-218(2)(a), MCA. Notably, of the other items of \u201cproperty\u201d set forth in \u00a7 15-6-218(2)(a), MCA (certificates of stock, bonds, promissory notes, copyrights, patents, trademarks, contracts, software, and franchises), several have already been recognized as \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Takings Clause. See Boyle v. United States, 200 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (copyrights); Roth v. Pritikin, 710 F.2d 934, 939 (2d Cir. 1983) (same); Leesona Corp. v. United States, 599 F.2d 958, 964 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (patents); Cienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (contracts); Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 579, 54 S. Ct. 840, 843 (1934) (same); City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, 646 P.2d 835, 839-40 (Cal. 1982) (patents, franchises, and contracts).\n\u00b6192 Our decision in Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, 2005 MT 146, 327 Mont. 306, 114 P.3d 1009, is also informative here. We held in Seven Up Pete that the enactment of 1-137 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking since the Venture had not acquired an operating permit to mine using cyanide prior to I-137\u2019s enactment and since the State retained substantial contractual and regulatory discretion regarding the issuance of such a permit. See Seven Up Pete, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Of particular relevance, we reasoned:\n[T]he passage of 1-137 did not take away any existing permits or halt any on-going mine operations related to the Venture\u2019s projects. Because the Venture had not obtained the requisite operating permit, it likewise had not obtained a right to mine. Moreover, it was not assured of ever obtaining such a right. Therefore, we conclude that the enactment of 1-137 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking.\nSeven Up Pete, \u00b6 33 (emphases added). It follows logically from this reasoning that under Montana law, the issuance of a permit or license is a significant act upon which a taking may be premised. Indeed, we dismissed the Venture\u2019s takings claim because it did not have an \u201cexisting\u201d permit and because 1-137 did not halt any \u201con-going\u201d mine operations. In contrast, the Ranchers did have \u201cexisting\u201d licenses; annual renewal of the licenses was a matter of right; and 1-143 did halt \u201con-going\u201d alternative livestock ranching operations-all of which indicates that the Ranchers had compensable property interests in their licenses.\n\u00b6193 To all of this, I would simply note that, contrary to the Court\u2019s recitation of the law in this area, courts have found government-issued licenses to be compensable property interests. See e.g. Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia v. Lieberman, 336 A.2d 249 (Pa. 1975); State v. Saugen, 169 N.W.2d 37 (Minn. 1969). Notably, in Stallinger v. Goss, 121 Mont. 437, 193 P.2d 810 (1948), this Court observed: \u201cSection 6672 of the Revised Codes of Montana 1935, defines personal property: \u2018Every kind of property that is not real is personal.\u2019 A retail liquor license is saleable and is personal property of value and subject to attachment.\u201d Stallinger, 121 Mont. at 438, 193 P.2d at 810. It would be a peculiar proposition to hold that a government-issued license is \u201cpersonal property of value\u201d for purposes of sale and attachment, but that it loses this quality for purposes of governmental appropriation.\n\u00b6194 The Court concedes that the Ranchers\u2019 licenses were transferrable. Opinion, \u00b6 47. The Court also concedes that neither Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA, nor the licenses themselves contained any express language precluding the formation of a compensable property interest. Opinion, \u00b6 48. Instead, the Court points out that a licensee was required to comply with applicable laws and regulations and that the State retained the power to amend the regulations or to revoke the license if the alternative livestock ranch was being operated in violation of the law. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. The Court also points out that at common law, wild animals were not subject to private ownership \u201c \u2018except in so far as the state may choose to make them so.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 50 (quoting Rosenfeld v. Jakways, 67 Mont. 558, 562, 216 P. 776, 777 (1923)). These points, however, miss the mark. Indeed, as the Court itself acknowledges in the very next breath, the government does not have the right (absent just compensation) to withdraw benefits it has conveyed or to qualify those benefits as it chooses when \u201cthe statute itself or surrounding circumstances\u201d indicate that the conveyances were \u201cintended to be irrevocable.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 50 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, at the risk of belaboring the point, the statutory scheme clearly provided that a license to \u201cacquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year\u201d was intended to be irrevocable, except if the licensee engaged in misconduct. Sections 87-4-412(1), -414(2), -423(1), -427(1), MCA (1999). There is neither evidence nor argument in this case that the Ranchers engaged in misconduct.\n\u00b6195 Lastly, the Court contends that the Ranchers did not have the right to exclude others from entering the alternative livestock industry. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53. On this basis, the Court concludes that the Ranchers\u2019 licenses \u201cdid not meet the three required criteria for compensability under Members\u201d and, thus, are not compensable property interests. Opinion, \u00b6 54. The Court never explains, however, why an inability to exclude others from entering the industry is dispositive of the \u201cproperty\u201d question. The Ranchers do not claim a property right in the alternative livestock industry, so why would they need to exclude others from it? Rather, according to the Court, they claim a property right in their licenses, and each Rancher obviously had title in his or her license to the exclusion of all others. In any event, the Court is flat wrong in asserting that the right to exclude is dispositive of the \u201cproperty\u201d question. \u201cPrecedent shows that the ability to exercise every one of the \u2018sticks\u2019 (rights) in the \u2018bundle\u2019 of fee simple rights at the time of a taking is not a prerequisite to establishing a valid property interest under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Cienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\u00b6196 In sum, I would hold that under the standards of Penn Central, 1-143 took from the Ranchers a traditional hallmark of property-the right to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses and, correspondingly, their businesses \u2014 and that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for this taking. Moreover, I disagree with the Court\u2019s contention that the licenses themselves are not property entitled to protection under the Takings Clause.\n2. The Intangible Business Assets\n\u00b6197 The Ranchers claim that 1-143 took the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses. It is useful at the outset to define these terms.\n\u00b6198 \u201c[A]n operating business can have a value in excess of the values of the separate assets that compose the business.\u201d Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain vol. 4, \u00a7 13.18[2], 13-169 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2007). Indeed, in the same way that a person is not just a collection of flesh, bones, and organs, a business is not just the sum of its parts. A going business has value because of its vitality, because of its ability to compete, and because of the synergy of its constituent parts which enable it efficiently to manufacture a good, market a product, or provide a service. It cannot be gainsaid that the value of a business assessed as a going concern is greater than the value of a business which has been dismantled and sold for its constituent assets (to the extent the assets even have value independent of the business). For instance, witness the difference in value of a farm or ranch sold as a working operation and one whose assets are sold at auction.\n\u00b6199 This difference is known as \u201cgoing-concern value,\u201d which is \u201c \u2018a term used to explain that assets that are a part of a going concern have greater value than the sum of the values of individual assets.\u2019 \u201d Warnick v. Warnick, 133 P.3d 997, \u00b6 15 n. 6 (Wyo. 2006) (quoting Donald J. Weidner & John W. Larson, The Revised Uniform Partnership Act: The Reporters\u2019 Overview, 49 Bus. Law. 1, 12 (1993)); see also Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain \u00a7 13.18[2], 13-168 (\u201c\u2018The term may be used to refer either to the total value of a going concern or that portion of the total value that exceeds the value of the other identifiable assets of the business.\u2019 \u201d (quoting R. Miles, Basic Business Appraisal 19 (John Wiley & Sons 1984))). Going-concern value also represents \u201cthe many advantages inherent in acquiring an operating business as compared to starting a new business with only land, buildings and equipment in place,\u201d Gray Line Bus Co. v. Greater Bridgeport Transit Dist., 449 A.2d 1036, 1039 (Conn. 1982), such as the avoidance of start-up costs and the ability to realize a higher rate of return than a newly established firm due to greater efficiency in operations, marketing, and administration, see Lynda J. Oswald, Goodwill and Going-Concern Value: Emerging Factors in the Just Compensation Equation, 32 B.C. L. Rev. 283, 289 (1991).\n\u00b6200 In contrast, \u201cgoodwill\u201d is \u201cthe expectation of continued public patronage.\u201d Section 30-13-121, MCA; Esselstyn v. Holmes, 42 Mont. 507, 516, 114 P. 118, 120 (1911). This expectation may be founded on reputation, regular customers, favorable location, good service, high-quality merchandise, capable staff, good relations with suppliers, and similar intangible concepts. See Baldwin v. Stuber, 182 Mont. 501, 506-07, 597 P.2d 1135, 1138 (1979); In re Marriage of Hull, 219 Mont. 480, 484, 712 P.2d 1317, 1320 (1986); BAA, PLC v. Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co., 929 A.2d 1, 17 n. 24 (Md. 2007); Dugan v. Dugan, 457 A.2d 1, 4-5 (N.J. 1983); Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain \u00a7 13.18[2], 13-167; 38 Am. Jur. 2d Good Will \u00a7 5 (1999). Thus, goodwill has been defined as \u201cthe advantages a business has over competitors as a result of its name, location and owner\u2019s reputation.\u201d Russell v. Jim Russell Supply, 558 N.E.2d 115, 121 (Ill. App. 5th Dist. 1990).\n\u00b6201 It is beyond dispute that goodwill and going-concern value are compensable property interests; this fact is recognized under both federal and state law. See Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, 525 F.3d 1370, 1382 n. 3 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\u201c[G]oing concern value and goodwill are indeed compensable property interests.\u201d); Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 13, 69 S. Ct. 1434, 1441 (1949) (\u201c[A]n exercise of the power of eminent domain which has the inevitable effect of depriving the owner of the going-concern value of his business is a compensable \u2018taking\u2019 of property.\u201d); Los Angeles Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U.S. 287, 313, 53 S. Ct. 637, 647 (1933) (\u201cThis Court has declared it to be self-evident that there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced, and that this element of value is a property right which should be considered in determining the value of the property, upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); \u00a7\u00a7 70-1-101, -104(4), MCA (defining \u201cproperty\u2019 to include \u201csuch products of labor or skill as ... the goodwill of a business\u201d); Esselstyn, 42 Mont. at 516, 114 P. at 120 (\u201cThe goodwill of a business ... is property capable of transfer, and the owner is entitled to the same protection in the exclusive enjoyment of it as he is in that of his tangible possessions.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\u00b6202 The question, therefore, is whether 1-143 effected a taking of the goodwill and going-concern value of the Ranchers\u2019 businesses. In my view, the answer to this question is an obvious \u201cYes.\u201d The District Court found-and I agree-that 1-143 had \u201ca significant economic impact on [the Ranchers\u2019] game farm businesses.\u201d See also Opinion, \u00b6 62 (\u201c[1-143] had a significant impact upon the value of their businesses.\u201d). Indeed, the Initiative effectively outlawed alternative livestock ranches. In this respect, like the total abrogation of the right to transfer their licenses, the character of the regulation vis-a-vis the Ranchers\u2019 goodwill and going-concern value is \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 716, 107 S. Ct. 2076, 2083 (1987). 1-143 was designed to shut down the Ranchers\u2019 businesses; it accomplished that purpose; and, in so doing, it fully devalued the goodwill and going-concern value of those businesses. As far as the Ranchers\u2019 goodwill and going-concern value are concerned, 1-143 is \u201cfunctionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\u201dLingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2082 (2005).\n\u00b6203 The Court points out repeatedly that the alternative livestock industry was \u201chighly regulated.\u201d Notably, the Court does not disclose the legal standard by which an industry may be judged \u201chighly regulated\u201d for purposes of takings analysis. More importantly, I question whether this fact is entitled to the significance given it by the Court. Indeed,\nthe fact that the industry is regulated [is not] dispositive. A business that operates in a heavily-regulated industry should reasonably expect certain types of regulatory changes that may affect the value of its investments. But that does not mean that all regulatory changes are reasonably foreseeable or that regulated businesses can have no reasonable investment-backed expectations whatsoever.\nCienega Gardens v. United States, 331 F.3d 1319, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Arctic King Fisheries, Inc. v. United States, 59 Fed. Cl. 360, 379 (2004) (\u201c[I]ndividuals operating in highly regulated fields do not forfeit their rights under the Fifth Amendment to the whim of whatever regulation the winds may bring.\u201d). Here, the Ranchers\u2019 investment-backed expectations certainly included the expectation that the regulatory scheme would be adjusted over time, as had been the case over the preceding 75 years. However, 1-143 did not \u201cadjust\u201d the regulatory scheme; rather, it rendered the scheme\u2019s existence entirely pointless, since none of the businesses in the industry can survive after 1-143. I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s fanciful suggestion that the Ranchers should have expected the passage of such a regulation, i.e., one that would render all of the other existing regulations moot. Cf. Cienega Gardens, 331 F.3d at 1350 (observing that \u201cone would not reasonably expect Congress to make legislative changes that would actually discourage parties from participating in the programs in the future\u201d).\n\u00b6204 In this connection, 1-143 must be distinguished from typical regulations. The Initiative did not directly address any of the concerns which led to its passage. 1-143 prohibited fee shooting; yet, it cannot plausibly be maintained that the act of paying a fee to shoot alternative livestock is itself the source of chronic wasting disease, the threat to fair-chase hunting ethics, and the discontent over \u201cEuropean style\u201d privatization of wildlife. Rather, the prohibition on fee shooting was a means to an end-namely, to shut down all alternative livestock ranches. Consequently, 1-143 differs from regulations that \u201cadjust\u201d the regulatory scheme in order to directly address a matter of public concern, such as the new fencing requirements imposed on alternative livestock ranches over the years and the moratorium placed on new applications for initial alternative livestock ranch licenses until a test for chronic wasting disease is developed and approved. While such regulations may incidentally impact the value of businesses in the industry, they are not even remotely in the same league as 1-143, which did not \u201cregulate\u201d alternative livestock ranches in the usual sense, but instead deliberately wiped out the economic viability of these businesses. A voter initiative prompted by dissatisfaction with insurance companies and which permitted such companies to continue issuing policies but prohibited them from charging premiums would achieve much the same result, as would an initiative that permitted coal-fired generation plants to continue operating but prohibited them from charging for the electricity they provided, or an initiative that permitted oil companies to continue selling gasoline but prohibited them from charging anything at the pump, or an initiative that permitted banks to continue loaning money but prohibited them from charging interest, or an initiative that permitted grain farmers to continue harvesting their crops but prohibited them from charging for their wheat. Obviously, the list is endless.\n\u00b6205 This case, therefore, does not involve a new regulation that has made operation of a business less profitable or has caused a slight diminution in a business\u2019s value. It has been said that \u201c[glovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\u201d Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 413, 43 S. Ct. 158, 159 (1922). 1-143, however, did not impose additional regulatory burdens on the business of alternative livestock ranching. Rather, it deliberately and effectively legislated all such businesses out of existence. As a result, the values incident to the Ranchers\u2019 property were not merely \u201cdiminished\u201d; they were largely obliterated. Cf. Martin v. District of Columbia, 205 U.S. 135, 139, 27 S. Ct. 440, 441 (1907) (\u201cConstitutional rights like others are matters of degree. To illustrate: Under the police power, in its strict sense, a certain limit might be set to the height of buildings without compensation; but to make that limit five feet would require compensation and a taking by eminent domain.\u201d).\n\u00b6206 On one hand, the Court acknowledges that the changes in the regulatory scheme brought about by 1-143 were \u201cradical.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 6. I agree. On the other hand, however, the Court suggests that the Ranchers should have reasonably anticipated such changes given the \u201chighly regulated\u201d nature of the alternative livestock industry. Opinion, \u00b6 93. In so doing, the Court ignores several critical facts supporting the Ranchers\u2019 investment-backed expectations in that industry. For one, the Legislature told the Ranchers that alternative livestock ranching was \u201ca viable economic opportunity.\u201d Section 87-4-431, MCA (1999). The Ranchers were also assured that they would be allowed to continue operating their alternative livestock businesses so long as they paid the license renewal fees, complied with all recording and reporting requirements, and did not engage in misconduct. Sections 87-4-412(1), -423(1), -427(1), MCA. Now, of course, they are being told that they may continue operating, but that they must do so without any income. The point here, however, is that the regulatory scheme itself engendered reasonable investment-backed expectations. Those, combined with the significant economic impact 1-143 had on the Ranchers\u2019 businesses and the extraordinary character of the regulation, lead me to conclude that 1-143 took the Ranchers\u2019 goodwill and going-concern value.\n\u00b6207 This conclusion is bolstered by precedents from other states, as well as a pre-Penn Central decision of the Supreme Court. Under the business losses rule, when the government condemns the real property upon which a business is operated, the owner recovers only the value of the real property and the fixtures taken. There is no recovery for loss of goodwill and going-concern value, loss of profits, and relocation or removal expenses. See Lynda J. Oswald, Goodwill and Going-Concern Value: Emerging Factors in the Just Compensation Equation, 32 B.C. L. Rev. 283, 286-87 (1991); see also e.g. United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 378-79, 66 S. Ct. 596, 599-600 (1946). One of the justifications for this rule is that the business can still be carried on elsewhere, the goodwill or going-concern value can be transferred with it to the new location without loss of value, and nothing, therefore, has been taken. Oswald, 32 B.C. L. Rev. at 310. Notably, the business losses rule has been subject to withering criticism and has been rejected by a number of courts and legislatures. See Oswald, 32 B.C. L. Rev. at 319-75; State v. Hammer, 550 P.2d 820, 823-26 (Alaska 1976); Bowers v. Fulton County, 146 S.E.2d 884, 889-91 (Ga. 1966); Michigan State Highway Commn. v. L & L Concession Co., 187 N.W.2d 465, 468-69 (Mich. App. 1971); Luber v. Milwaukee County, 177 N.W.2d 380, 383-86 (Wis. 1970); City of Janesville v. CC Midwest, Inc., 734 N.W.2d 428, \u00b6 80 (Wis. 2007) (Prosser, J., dissenting).\n\u00b6208 An exception to the business losses rule applies where the business was destroyed or made otherwise unusable as a result of the governmental action. In Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 69 S. Ct. 1434 (1949), for instance, the government took temporary possession of a laundry, and the Laundry, having no other means of serving its customers, suspended business for the duration of the government\u2019s occupancy. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 3, 69 S. Ct. at 1436-37. Thereafter, the Laundry claimed entitlement to compensation for the loss of goodwill and going-concern value during the occupancy. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 8, 69 S. Ct. at 1439. The Supreme Court agreed. The Court first rejected the notion that the intangible nature of these assets precluded recovery, observing that since the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for the value of a business\u2019s physical property, it also requires compensation for the value of intangible assets. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 11, 69 S. Ct. at 1440. The Court then discussed the rule that where an owner is free to move his business to a new location, there is no compensation for going-concern value since this asset has not been \u201ctaken.\u201d Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 11-12, 69 S. Ct. at 1440-41. Conversely, the Court observed, this rule does not apply where the owner retains nothing of the going-concern value that he formerly possessed. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 12-13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441. Indeed, the Court stated that \u201can exercise of the power of eminent domain which has the inevitable effect of depriving the owner of the going-concern value of his business is a compensable \u2018taking\u2019 of property.\u201d Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441. Thus, for example, when the government condemns business property with the intention of carrying on the business, \u201cthe going-concern value of the business is at the Government\u2019s disposal whether or not it chooses to avail itself of it. Since what the owner had has transferable value, the situation is apt for the oft-quoted remark of Mr. Justice Holmes, \u2018the question is, What has the owner lost? not, What has the taker gained?\u2019 \u201d Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 12, 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441. The Court concluded that the situation at hand came within this principle. See Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 14, 69 S. Ct. at 1442.\n\u00b6209 The Minnesota Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in State v. Saugen, 169 N.W.2d 37 (Minn. 1969). In that case, the government condemned property upon which the condemnee had been operating a lounge. The condemnee had attempted to transfer the going-concern value of the business to another location but could not do so due to a restriction on the transfer of his liquor license. The issue on appeal, therefore, was \u201cwhether the going-concern value of a liquor lounge, operating under a valid city liquor license, is property taken, destroyed, or damaged by the state\u2019s condemnation of the premises for which compensation should be given.\u201d Saugen, 169 N.W.2d at 39. The court first held that neither the intangible character of going-concern value nor the fact that the lounge was operated under the authority of a license precluded compensation for a taking. Saugen, 169 N.W.2d at 39-42. The court then acknowledged \u201cthe general rule that loss of going-concern value is not recoverable on condemnation.\u201d Saugen, 169 N. W.2d at 42. However, the court held that this rule was inapplicable given that the condemnee had been unable to relocate the business and, therefore, the going-concern value had been effectively destroyed. See Saugen, 169 N.W.2d at 46; see also City of Minneapolis v. Schutt, 256 N.W.2d 260, 265 (Minn. 1977) (stating that compensation for the destruction of going-concern value is permitted where the business \u201ceither cannot be relocated as a practical matter, or... relocation would result in irreparable harm to the interest\u201d).\n\u00b6210 In Detroit v. Michael\u2019s Prescriptions, 373 N.W.2d 219 (Mich. App. 1985), the court summarized the rule in Michigan as follows:\n[R]ecovery of the going concern value of a business lost to condemnation will depend on the transferability of that business to another location. If the business can be transferred, nothing is taken and compensation is therefore not required.... Generally, however, recovery will be allowed where the business derives its success from a location not easily duplicated or where relocation is foreclosed for reasons relating to the entire condemnation project.\nMichael\u2019s Prescriptions, 373 N.W.2d at 224-25; see also L & L Concession, 187 N.W.2d at 469.\n\u00b6211 Applying these principles here, the Ranchers\u2019 businesses cannot be relocated as a practical matter, since 1-143 effectively \u201coutlawed\u201d alternative livestock ranches in this State. Opinion, \u00b6 92. Consequently, the goodwill and going-concern value of the businesses cannot be transferred to a new location. To the contrary, the goodwill and going-concern value have been destroyed by the passage of 1-143. As a result, the Ranchers have been completely deprived of these assets. A governmental action which has \u201cthe inevitable effect of depriving the owner of the going-concern value of his business is a compensable \u2018taking\u2019 of property.\u201d Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441.\n\u00b6212 Before concluding, I again pause to address the Court\u2019s approach. The Court acknowledges at the outset that intangibles such as goodwill and going-concern value are \u201cproperty\u201d under Montana law. Opinion, \u00b6 55. The Court also acknowledges that goodwill and going-concern value are compensable property interests under Kimball Laundry. Opinion, \u00b6 56. Yet, the Court adopts as \u201ctrue\u201d the District Court\u2019s highly questionable assertion that intangibles such as goodwill and going-concern value are compensable only in eminent domain proceedings, and not in the regulatory takings context. Opinion, \u00b6 55. I am aware of no authority-and the Court cites none-standing for the proposition that a property interest, for which the owner is entitled to compensation in a direct condemnation action, is not also compensable in a regulatory takings action. I must also confess that the rationale for such a distinction escapes me, particularly given the lack of any textual support for it in the Takings Clause, which simply states: \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.\n\u00b6213 Next, the Court attempts to avoid the rule of Kimball Laundry by limiting that case to \u201cthose rare circumstances where the government actually intends to take over the claimant\u2019s business and thereby appropriate the goodwill and going-concern value for its own use.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 56. Nothing in Kimball Laundry supports this narrow reading of the opinion. To the contrary, the Supreme Court stated:\n[A]n exercise of the power of eminent domain which has the inevitable effect of depriving the owner of the going-concern value of his business is a compensable \u201ctaking\u201d of property. If such a deprivation has occurred, the going-concern value of the business is at the Government\u2019s disposal whether or not it chooses to avail itself of it.\nKimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441 (emphasis added, citations omitted).\n\u00b6214 The critical fact in Kimball Laundry was not the government\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 56) or \u201cactual physical occupation\u201d of the laundry (Opinion, \u00b6 57). Rather, it was the inability of the Laundry to transfer its going-concern value to another location. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 14-16, 69 S. Ct. at 1442-43. Moreover, the Court should take note that \u201c \u2018the Constitution measures a taking of property not by what a State says, or by what it intends, but by what it does.\u2019 \u201d San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S. 621, 652-53, 101 S. Ct. 1287, 1304 (1981) (Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, & Powell, JJ., dissenting) (quoting Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 298, 88 S. Ct. 438, 443 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis in Hughes), and citing Davis v. Newton Coal Co., 267 U.S. 292, 301, 45 S. Ct. 305, 306 (1925)). Notably, in attempting to limit Kimball Laundry, the Court places the focus of the analysis on what the State gained. This approach is contrary to the rule that our focus must be on what the property owner lost. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441 (\u201c \u2018[T]he question is, What has the owner lost? not, What has the taker gained?\u2019 \u201d); see also United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 261, 66 S. Ct. 1062, 1065-66 (1946). From the Ranchers\u2019 perspective, there is no difference between the State\u2019s taking over their businesses, thereby appropriating the goodwill and going-concern value for its own use, and the State\u2019s shutting down the businesses through a regulatory enactment so that no one can operate them at all. The Court\u2019s attempt to distinguish the two is pure sophistry.\n\u00b6215 Lastly, the Court posits that \u201ctaking of goodwill or going-concern value differs markedly from other types of taking.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 57. The Court speculates that \u201c[t]his is likely because what the claimant alleges has been \u2018taken\u2019 is an expectation of future profitability.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 57. Proceeding on this assumption, the Court cites and discusses a number of cases for the proposition that an expectation of future profitability is not a compensable property interest. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 57-62. At the conclusion of these citations, the Court baldly rewrites the Ranchers\u2019 claim that 1-143 took their \u201cintangible business assets\u201d as a claim that 1-143 took their \u201cability to profit from fee-shooting.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 63. Having thus transformed the Ranchers\u2019 claim, the Court reaches the conclusion that the Ranchers\u2019 \u201cability to profit from fee-shooting\u201d is not compensable \u201cbecause there has been no physical condemnation or occupation of [the Ranchers\u2019] property by the State.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 63.\n\u00b6216 This conclusion is truly perplexing. For one thing, the Court expends several pages arguing that an expectation of future profitability is not a compensable property interest, only to reach the conclusion that an ability to profit is compensable if the State physically condemns or occupies the business. Moreover, I am not persuaded that an \u201cability to profit from fee-shooting\u201d is compensable if the State \u201cphysically condemns or occupies\u201d the Ranchers\u2019 property but is not compensable if the State simply passes a regulation putting the Ranchers out of business. That the Court treats these two scenarios as constitutionally distinct, without a shred of authority for support, is troubling.\n\u00b6217 Ultimately, however, the distinction is irrelevant because the Ranchers do not claim a taking of their \u201cability to profit from fee-shooting.\u201d What they claim, rather, is that 1-143 took the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses. These are existing, quantifiable, and compensable property interests, recognized as such in the cases cited above. Where the government deprives an owner of the goodwill and going-concern value of his business, it is a compensable taking of property. Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 13, 69 S. Ct. at 1441. In my view, that proposition is sufficient to resolve the Ranchers\u2019 claims with respect to their intangible business assets.\n\u00b6218 In sum, I would hold that 1-143 took the goodwill and going-concern value of the Ranchers\u2019 businesses and that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for this taking. Moreover, I disagree with the Court\u2019s entire discussion at \u00b6\u00b6 55-64. In order to reject the Ranchers\u2019 legitimate takings claims, the Court manufactures a novel new rule: Although a business owner may be deprived of the goodwill and going-concern value of his business by either regulation or direct appropriation, he is entitled to compensation only in the latter circumstance. There is no logical reason, no persuasive justification, and no legal authority offered in support of this incongruous rule. What the Court fails to recognize is that the ultimate question in a Fifth Amendment regulatory takings analysis is whether the regulation is \u201cso onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.\u201d Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 537, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 2081 (2005). Certainly, if a regulation is so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation of goodwill or going-concern value \u2014 and 1-143 is such a regulation \u2014 then just compensation is required.\n3. The Real Estate Interests and Fixtures\n\u00b6219 Given the prolonged discussions under the two preceding categories, only a brief discussion is necessary here. First, I tend to agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that 1-143 did not take the Ranchers\u2019 real estate. Opinion, \u00b6 80. However, there is a glaring omission from the Court\u2019s discussion: an analysis of the fixtures. The Court\u2019s heading reads, \u201cAppellants\u2019 Real Estate Interests and Fixtures,\u201d and the Court mentions fixtures several times in \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. Yet, nowhere is there a discrete analysis of the fixtures. Rather, the Court seems to lump them together with the land. This, in my view, is error. The Ranchers installed a number of fixtures on their property specifically designed for the purpose of operating alternative livestock ranches, including fences and certain outbuildings. To the extent 1-143 has rendered these fixtures valueless, I conclude that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for essentially the same reasons I concluded above that they are entitled to just compensation for the loss of their right to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses and businesses and for the loss of their intangible business assets.\n4. The Alternative Livestock\n\u00b6220 The last category is the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock. Everyone agrees that the alternative livestock is a compensable property interest. See Opinion, \u00b6 66. Thus, the question is whether this property was \u201ctaken\u201d under the Penn Central standards.\n\u00b6221 The Court observes that the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock suffered \u201csignificant devaluation\u201d as a result of 1-143 and that the diminished value was insufficient even to cover the cost of raising and maintaining the livestock. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 85. As a matter of fact, the Ranchers can sell their alternative livestock only at a loss. Opinion, \u00b6 85. The Court concludes, therefore, that the economic-impact factor \u201cweighs in favor of finding a compensable taking\u201d of the alternative livestock. Opinion, \u00b6 85. I generally agree with these observations; however, given that 1-143 devalued the alternative livestock by 70 to 95 percent, Opinion, \u00b6 84, and given that the primary focus of our analysis is on \u201cthe severity of the burden that [1-143] imposes upon private property rights,\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082, I conclude that the economic-impact factor weighs very heavily in favor of the Ranchers\u2019 claims.\n\u00b6222 The Court next addresses the character of the governmental action. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 86-88. The Court acknowledges that 1-143 placed the economic burden of eliminating alternative livestock ranches \u201csquarely on the shoulders\u201d of the individuals in the industry and that \u201cindividuals like [the Ranchers], and not the public as a whole, are being asked to bear the burden.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 86. This, the Court recognizes, \u201cseems to run afoul\u201d of the rule that the State may not \u201c !forc[e] some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 86 (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563, 1569 (1960)). On all of these points, I agree.\n\u00b6223 I do not agree, however, with the Court\u2019s subsequent attempt to downplay I-143\u2019s intrusion on the Ranchers\u2019 property rights as \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cminimal.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 88. The Court points out that the State has not seized the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock. True, but the alternative livestock no longer have any economically viable use, as the Court itself acknowledges in \u00b6 85 (noting that the value of the livestock is \u201cinsufficient to even cover the cost of raising and maintaining [them]\u201d and that the Ranchers \u201ccould only sell the alternative livestock at a loss\u201d). That is tantamount to seizing the alternative livestock. Cf. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1017, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 2894 (1992) (\u201c[T]otal deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner\u2019s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation.\u201d). The Court also contends that 1-143 merely prohibited one use of the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock and left them open to exploit other uses of the livestock. For instance, the Court proposes that the Ranchers could sell the alternative livestock (admittedly, at a loss) to out-of-state markets or \u201callow others to shoot [the alternative livestock] in Montana, so long as no fee is charged.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 87. However, these entirely unprofitable (not to mention implausible) uses of the alternative livestock only persuade me further that I-143\u2019s impact is far from \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cminimal.\u201d\n\u00b6224 The Court\u2019s attempt to analogize this case to Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 100 S. Ct. 318 (1979), is similarly unpersuasive. Andrus involved federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The regulations prohibited commercial transactions in parts of birds that had been legally killed before the birds came under the protection of the Acts. The appellees were engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts composed partly of the feathers of protected birds, and these artifacts existed before the regulations went into effect. One of the issues on appeal, therefore, was whether \u201cthe Eagle Protection and Migratory Bird Treaty Acts violate appellees\u2019 Fifth Amendment property rights because the prohibition [on commercial transactions in preexisting avian artifacts] wholly deprives them of the opportunity to earn a profit from those relics.\u201d See Andrus, 444 U.S. at 52-55, 64, 100 S. Ct. at 320-21, 326.\n\u00b6225 In answering this question, the Supreme Court observed that the challenged regulations neither compelled the surrender of, nor imposed a physical restraint on, the artifacts; rather, they imposed a restriction on one means of disposing of the artifacts. Andrus, 444 U.S. at 65, 100 S. Ct. at 327. The Court acknowledged that the regulations prevented \u201cthe most profitable use\u201d of the appellees\u2019 property; at the same time, however, it was \u201cnot clear that appellees will be unable to derive economic benefit from the artifacts.\u201d Andrus, 444 U.S. at 66, 100 S. Ct. at 327. The Court ultimately concluded that in the absence of any physical property restriction, the reduction in profits-i.e., the difference between the most profitable use of the property pre-regulation and the most profitable use of the property post-regulation-was too speculative and, thus, \u201ca slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim.\u201d Andrus, 444 U.S. at 66, 100 S. Ct. at 327. Hence, the Court held that the prohibition on the sale of the bird feathers did not amount to a taking. Andrus, 444 U.S. at 67-68, 100 S. Ct. at 328.\n\u00b6226 As an initial matter, the extent to which the holding of Andrus may be extended beyond the specific facts of that case is questionable. See Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 719, 107 S. Ct. 2076, 2085 (1987) (Scalia, J., Rehnquist, C.J., & Powell, J., concurring) (concluding that \u201cin finding a taking today our decision effectively limits Allard to its facts\u201d); but see Irving, 481 U.S. at 718, 107 S. Ct. at 2084 (Brennan, Marshall, & Blackmun, JJ., concurring) (\u201cI find nothing in today\u2019s opinion that would limit Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 100 S.Ct. 318 (1979), to its facts.\u201d). But, setting that question aside, the character of the governmental action in Andrus is, in any event, totally distinguishable from the character of the governmental action here.\n\u00b6227 The regulations at issue in Andrus were designed to prevent the destruction of certain species of birds, which in turn caused an incidental reduction in profits for those engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts. But the appellees still had the opportunity to use their property in other economically viable ways. Andrus, 444 U.S. at 66, 100 S. Ct. at 327.1-143, by contrast, was not designed to regulate the use, care, or disposal of alternative livestock. Rather, it was designed to regulate the price of penned hunts so as to eliminate the alternative livestock\u2019s value completely. It is important, in this regard, to recall that the Sportsmen\u2019s concerns in drafting 1-143 were with chronic wasting disease (\u201cCWD\u201d), unethical hunting, and private ownership of game animals. Obviously, all of these concerns could be resolved in one fell swoop by simply seizing the alternative livestock and prohibiting private ownership of game animals, but such action clearly would require the payment of compensation. Alternatively, the Sportsmen\u2019s goals could be achieved if the Ranchers were left with no choice but to get rid of their alternative livestock, but that would not likely occur if the Ranchers were able to derive economic benefit from them. Thus, the Sportsmen \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d 1-143 to eliminate all economically beneficial use of the alternative livestock.\n\u00b6228 Ironically, in so doing, and in spite of their concern with diseases, the Sportsmen gave the Ranchers an incentive to neglect their alternative livestock and allow them to become diseased. That way, the government would destroy the animals and pay the Ranchers for the loss. Compare 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 55.2 (\u201cThe Administrator is authorized to pay for the purchase and destruction of CWD positive animals, CWD exposed animals, and CWD suspect animals. Subject to available funding, the amount of the Federal payment for any such animals will be 95 percent of the appraised value established in accordance with \u00a7 55.3 of this part, but the Federal payment shall not exceed $3,000 per animal.\u201d), with Opinion, \u00b6 84 (observing that the Ranchers were getting between $500 and $1,800 per animal selling them on the market). 1-143 and this Court\u2019s decision, therefore, create the perverse result that good stewards of animals whose healthy herds are devalued by way of a \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d political ploy receive nothing, while those whose herds have become diseased due to careless management receive compensation. One has to wonder where there is \u201cfairness and justice\u201d in such a scheme.\n\u00b6229 In any event, given that 1-143 specifically targets the Ranchers to bear the entire burden of eliminating alternative livestock ranches, and given that 1-143, for all intents and purposes, caused \u201cthe complete elimination of [the alternative livestock\u2019s] value,\u201d Lingle, 544 U.S. at 539, 125 S. Ct. at 2082 (citing Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1017, 112 S. Ct. at 2894); cf. Yancey v. United States, 915 F.2d 1534, 1541-42 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (finding a compensable taking where \u201cthe Yanceys had no choice but to sell their birds for substantially less than their value\u201d), I conclude that the character of the governmental action weighs heavily in favor of the conclusion that 1-143 effected a taking of the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock.\n\u00b6230 Lastly, the Court addresses the Ranchers\u2019 investment-backed expectations. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 89-93. The Court acknowledges that the whole reason the Ranchers expended \u201csignificant financial resources\u201d on their respective operations was to offer penned hunts. Opinion, \u00b6 89. Yet, the Court then asserts that it was unreasonable for the Ranchers \u201cto maintain an investment-backed expectation that they would always be able to charge a fee to shoot alternative livestock in Montana.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 89. The Court points out that \u201cthe State never assured [the Ranchers] they would always be permitted to charge a fee to shoot alternative livestock in Montana.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 92.\n\u00b6231 With all due respect, the foregoing proposition is preposterous. The right to receive remuneration, in one form or another, for one\u2019s lawful goods and services has always been a part of this country\u2019s economic system. It is one thing to regulate the prices at which goods and services may be sold, but it is quite another to impose a price ceiling of$0.00. No business would, or should, ever expect that the State may require it to offer its goods and services for free. Cf. Stone v. Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Co. (Railroad Commission Cases), 116 U.S. 307, 331, 6 S. Ct. 334, 345 (1886) (\u201cThis power to regulate is not a power to destroy, and limitation is not the equivalent of confiscation. Under pretense of regulating fares and freights, the state cannot require a railroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward; neither can it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for public use without just compensation, or without due process of law.\u201d).\n\u00b6232 The Court offers a second theory that is only slightly more plausible than the first. Specifically, the Court asserts that due to \u201csignificant public unrest,\u201d the Ranchers \u201cknew, or should have known,\u201d that alternative livestock ranches were \u201chighly controversial\u201d and that initiative measures could be passed which would outlaw such operations entirely. Opinion, \u00b6 92. The Court thus reasons that the Ranchers \u201ccould not maintain a reasonable investment-backed expectation\u201d that the industry would not someday be \u201ccompletely abolished.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 93.\n\u00b6233 There are several flaws-factual as well as legal-with this theory. First, the history of alternative livestock ranching does not support the expectations the Court attributes to the Ranchers. The \u201cpublic unrest\u201d that led to 1-143 was not new. As a matter of fact, the 1982 Game Farm Task Force was created specifically to address then-existing public concerns and controversy surrounding alternative livestock ranching. See Part II-A, supra. But that controversy did not lead to the out-and-out elimination of the industry. To the contrary, it resulted in a compromise involving, on one hand, the imposition of new requirements on alternative livestock ranch operations and, on the other hand, the codification of certain \u201crights\u201d designed to protect the interests of participants in the alternative livestock industry. Thus, if the Ranchers should have expected a change due to the \u201cpublic unrest\u201d existing in the 1990s, additional safety and testing requirements are far more plausible than a regulation designed to put them out of business by prohibiting remuneration for penned hunts. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that the changes in the regulatory scheme brought about by 1-143 were \u201cradical.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 6.\n\u00b6234 Second, and along these same lines, it is important to recall that nothing in the \u201cpublic unrest\u201d prior to 1-143 had anything to do with the size of the fees the Ranchers were charging for penned hunts or the fact that fees were being charged. Therefore, even if the Ranchers should have anticipated some adjustments to the regulatory scheme, a prohibition on charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock cannot fairly be categorized as one such adjustment-especially since penned hunts are still perfectly legal, as long as they are conducted for free.\n\u00b6235 Third, notwithstanding the \u201cpublic unrest\u201d to which the Court refers, the 1999 Legislature passed a statute which read: \u201cThe legislature recognizes that the production of alternative livestock provides a viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.\u201d Section 87-4-431, MCA. It is quite far-fetched to assert, as the Court does, that the Ranchers should have anticipated the State was on the verge of abolishing alternative livestock ranching when the Legislature, meanwhile, was passing a statute characterizing the activity as \u201ca viable economic opportunity.\u201d Given that alternative livestock ranching had been a lawful \u201cbusiness or occupation\u201d in this State for over 75 years, and given that an alternative livestock ranch license was renewable as a matter of right and could not be revoked unless the licensee engaged in misconduct, \u00a7\u00a7 87-4-412(1), -423(1), -427(1), MCA, it was far more reasonable for the Ranchers to maintain investment-backed expectations that their ability to continue operating their alternative livestock ranches was secure.\n\u00b6236 Lastly, at a more fundamental level, I question the Court\u2019s reliance on what the Ranchers \u201cknew, or should have known.\u201d The Court opines that a regulation does not take property if it was \u201creasonably anticipated.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 93. But if the notion of a \u201cregulatory taking\u201d is to have any vitality, then the Court\u2019s theory must be roundly rejected. It is unlikely in today\u2019s world, where regulations of property are prevalent, that any property owner could ever argue that a particular regulation was unexpected or not reasonably anticipated. \u201c[Ejxcept for a regulation of almost unimaginable abruptness, all regulation will build on prior regulation and hence be said to defeat any expectations. Thus regulation begets regulation.\u201d District Intown Properties v. District of Columbia, 198 F.3d 874, 887 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (Williams, J., concurring in the judgment). If the meaning of \u201ctaking\u201d may be qualified by the degree to which a regulation is \u201creasonably anticipated,\u201d then \u201cthe natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears.\u201d Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160 (1922).\n\u00b6237 That is exactly the untenable result under the Court\u2019s approach: A business that operates in an industry with a history of regulation must expect that the regulations may be strengthened to achieve public needs, and this expectation, in turn, negates any entitlement the business might otherwise have to compensation for a taking. Indeed, this expectation, according to the Court, outweighs even a \u201csignificant devaluation\u201d of property disproportionately placed on the business. Such an approach drains the doctrine of \u201cregulatory takings\u201d of all force and purpose. There is no basis in logic or in the Takings Clause for distinguishing between two equally burdened property owners on the ground that one of them had advance notice of the regulation while the other was caught completely off guard. Either private property rights were taken, or they were not. If the former, just compensation must be paid, irrespective of the amount of notice the property owner had of the regulation\u2019s enactment.\n\u00b6238 In my view, the Ranchers\u2019 had reasonable investment-backed expectations related to their alternative livestock, given the long history of alternative livestock ranching, the statutory provisions designed to protect the interests of participants in the industry, and the Legislature\u2019s pronouncement that this activity was \u201ca viable economic opportunity.\u201d I conclude that this factor weighs in favor of the Ranchers\u2019 claims.\n\u00b6239 Having analyzed the three Penn Central factors, I would hold that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for the \u201csubstantial devaluation\u201d of their alternative livestock. While we may disagree as to the reasonableness of the Ranchers\u2019 investment-backed expectations in light of the \u201csignificant public unrest,\u201d I believe that the three factors, taken together, mandate the conclusion that 1-143 effected a taking of the Ranchers\u2019 alternative livestock. Both the economic impact of 1-143 on the value of the alternative livestock and the character of the regulation weigh heavily in favor of this conclusion.\n5. Conclusion of Fifth Amendment Analysis\n\u00b6240 In conclusion, based on the foregoing Penn Central analysis, I would hold that I-143 effected a taking of the Ranchers\u2019 right to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses and businesses, of the goodwill and going-concern value of their businesses, of the fixtures related to their alternative livestock operations, and of their alternative livestock. I would farther hold that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for these takings. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings related to the issue of just compensation.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6241 You take my house, when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life,\nWhen you do take the means whereby I live.\n\u00b6242 Arguably, 1-143 was a fraud on the voters. It purported to address a number of \u201cproblems\u201d associated with alternative livestock ranching, but it did not actually address any of those problems-at least, not directly. Instead, it eliminated the means whereby the Ranchers businesses existed, thereby destroying those businesses. The voters were not told that the Initiative was a \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d end-around the Constitution that could lead to a decision from this Court holding that the State may destroy the goodwill and going-concern value of a Montana business, substantially (if not completely) devalue the business\u2019s assets, and deprive the business owner of her right to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer the business-all without having to pay just compensation.\n\u00b6243 The Court invokes notions of \u201cfairness and justice\u201d to deny the Ranchers any compensation for the out-and-out obliteration of their businesses. 1-143 was designed to shut down an industry that the State had facilitated, and even encouraged, for 83 years and to place the entire economic burden of doing so on the participants in that industry. It is difficult to see any fairness or justice in this bait and switch, particularly since the Initiative was promoted as addressing legitimate public concerns shared not only by the Sportsmen, but by the public as a whole. A majority of voters-specifically, 204,282 of them-believed that the concerns cited by I-143\u2019s Proponents warranted \u201cgame farm reform.\u201d Given the severity of the burden this \u201creform\u201d entailed, and given that the \u201creform\u201d was intended to benefit all of Montana, fairness and justice require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation, not disproportionately placed on the shoulders of the alternative livestock ranchers.\n\u00b6244 The economic impact on the Ranchers\u2019 various assets as a result of 1-143 is unquestionably substantial. The character of the governmental action-total abrogation of property rights in and related to the Ranchers\u2019 businesses-is extraordinary. And the Ranchers\u2019 distinct investment-backed expectations in their ability to continue operating their businesses were quite reasonable in light of the history of alternative livestock ranching and the various assurances set out in the statutory scheme. \u201c[Wjhile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\u201d Mahon, 260 U.S. at 415, 43 S. Ct. at 160. In light of the foregoing, 1-143 went too far, and just compensation is due.\n\u00b6245 Aside from the immediate impact of the Court\u2019s decision on the Ranchers, the Opinion will, obviously, serve as precedent in future Montana takings cases. This Dissent is long-and will, no doubt, be criticized by some for that. However, I believe that the important issues implicated by the Ranchers\u2019 takings claims justified setting out, in detail, the reasons why federal takings jurisprudence is confused, often inconsistent, certainly not bulletproof, and not necessarily worthy of this Court\u2019s \u201cmarching lockstep\u201d with it. I hope this Dissent will give some future takings litigant the impetus and ammunition to challenge federal caselaw in arguing that her facially broader fundamental rights under Article II, Section 29 should be upheld.\n\u00b6246 Additionally, I am very concerned that the Court\u2019s decision here will be used-and, more likely, misused-in government\u2019s ever-expanding reach to regulate-and, ultimately, take-Montanans\u2019 broadly-defined property rights, without having to assume and spread amongst all taxpayers the economic burdens of that regulation and taking. Similarly, I am concerned that today\u2019s decision will encourage more \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d initiatives and legislation which end-run constitutional guarantees and mislead voters with smoke and mirrors. Finally, I am concerned that, recognizing \u201cIf they can do it to them, they can do it to me,\u201d citizens will propose and enact initiatives of the recent 1-154 ilk-poorly drafted, overbroad, and underinclusive. Indeed, we invite the Legislature to enact laws to protect constitutional rights when this Court refuses to define and enforce those rights.\n\u00b6247 It is for all of these reasons I would hold that the Ranchers have established compensable property interests and have demonstrated that those property interests were \u201ctaken\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for further proceedings on the issue of just compensation.\n\u00b6248 Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary decision.\nJUSTICE RICE and DISTRICT COURT JUDGE SWANDAL, sitting for JUSTICE MORRIS, join the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.\nPennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 416, 43 S. Ct. 158, 160 (1922).\nChicago, B & Q has been cited as the case in which the protections of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause were made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See e.g. Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 122, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 2658 (1978); Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 383-84, 114 S. Ct. 2309, 2316 (1994). However, Chicago, B & Q contains no mention of either the Takings Clause or the Fifth Amendment. Rather, the case was decided on substantive due process grounds. The Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201crequires compensation to be made or adequately secured to the owner of private property taken for public use under the authority of a State.\u201d See Chicago, B & Q, 166 U.S. at 235-41, 17 S. Ct. at 584-86; see also Dolan, 512 U.S. at 405-06, 114 S. Ct. at 2326-27 (Stevens, Blackmun, & Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting). This compensation requirement derived from \u201cuniversal law\u201d and \u201cnatural equity,\u201d not the Fifth Amendment. See Chicago, B & Q, 166 U.S. at 236, 17 S. Ct. at 584; Karkkainen, 90 Minn. L. Rev. at 829-30.
