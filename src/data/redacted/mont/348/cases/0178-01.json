We reverse in part and affirm in part.\n\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal, restated as follows:\n\u00b63 I. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury that \u201c[gjenerally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view?\u201d\n\u00b64 II. Did the District Court err by dismissing Count II of the Tarltons\u2019 complaint, which sought a declaration from the District Court that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence?\n\u00b65 III. Did the District Court err by excluding evidence that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence allegedly violated a local building code or by denying the Tarltons\u2019 request for a jury view of the properties?\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\u00b66 This case arises from a dispute between the Tarltons and Kaufmans, landowners who own adjoining properties along Lolo Creek near the rural community of Lolo, Montana. According to both parties, the dispute arose sometime in 2005, after the Tarltons either installed or repaired several yard lights on their property. The Kaufmans contend that the lights \u201cinterfered with the natural night-time beauty of the rural setting, prevented [Mr. Kaufman] from practicing his astronomy hobby and forced Kim Kaufman to abandon her bedroom just so she could get some sleep.\u201d\n\u00b67 Shortly after the lights were repaired, Kim Kaufman asked Bob Tarlton to install shields over the lights. According to the Kaufmans, the Tarltons refused this request. The Tarltons claim they initially decided to keep the lights off, but that an incident involving an unidentifiable car in their driveway late one night convinced them to keep at least one of the lights on. After an additional complaint about the lights from the Kaufmans, which allegedly included an offer from the Kaufmans to pay for light shields, Bob Tarlton installed his own shield on one of the yard lights. After the installation of the shield, the Kaufmans and Tarltons apparently did not discuss the lights again.\n\u00b68 Early in the summer of 2006, a separate conflict between the Tarltons and Kaufmans arose. This time, the dispute allegedly resulted from Bob Tarlton\u2019s maintenance of a pond that spans both the Tarltons\u2019 and Kaufmans\u2019 properties. According to the Tarltons, Jim Kaufman was angered by the maintenance of the pond and allegedly told Bob Tarlton that he could not legally maintain it. Thereafter, Bob Tarlton approached the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (\u201cDNRC\u201d) to determine whether he could lawfully maintain the pond. According to the Tarltons, the DNRC stated he could. While distinct from the dispute over the yard lights, the disagreement over the pond allegedly contributed to a further deterioration of the relationship between the Tarltons and Kaufmans.\n\u00b69 In July of 2006, the Kaufmans began constructing the fence that is the subject of this dispute. When complete, the chain link fence stood approximately 20 feet above a newly constructed 6-foot high berm, measured 270 feet in length, and was covered in two layers of dark material. The Tarltons argue that the fence does not enclose anything and that it is not supported structurally. The Tarltons also believe the fence is a spite fence, constructed \u201csolely to harass, annoy, and irritate\u201d them. The Kaufmans, on the other hand, contend that the fence is structurally sound and that they had no choice but to take some measures to block the glare from the Tarltons\u2019 yard lights.\n\u00b610 The Tarltons initiated the present action following the construction of the fence, alleging in Count I of their complaint that the fence constituted a nuisance under \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA. Specifically, the Tarltons alleged that the fence destroyed the aesthetic value of their property, that it reduced the value of their property, that it destroyed their view, and that it was an eyesore. Count II of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment from the District Court that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence. The Tarltons also claimed they were entitled to injunctive relief and asked for punitive damages. The Kaufmans counterclaimed that the Tarltons\u2019 yard lights constituted a nuisance, stating that the lights \u201cunreasonably interfered] with the Kaufmans\u2019 pursuit of their hobbies, disturbed] wildlife in the area and interfered] with the Kaufmans\u2019 general use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d\n\u00b611 Following the initiation of this action, both parties made several procedural maneuvers, few of which are relevant to this appeal. However, the Tarltons do contend on appeal that the District Court erred by either granting or denying a variety of motions, which we now explain.\n\u00b612 The first motion in contention on appeal is the Kaufmans\u2019 motion to dismiss Count II (Declaratory Judgment) of the Tarltons\u2019 complaint. Despite the Tarltons\u2019 argument that the District Court could appropriately declare the fence a spite fence under the Montana Declaratory Judgments Act, the District Court dismissed the claim, reasoning that the question of \u201c[w]hether the fence is a spite fence involves numerous disputed questions of fact, which are properly the subject of trial on the merits.\u201d\n\u00b613 The second motion in contention on appeal is a motion in limine filed by the Kaufmans prior to trial. In this motion, the Kaufmans asked the District Court to exclude any evidence that the fence violated \u201cany county ordinance\u201d or that it is \u201cunpermitted or illegal\u201d on the basis that such evidence is \u201cirrelevant and immaterial to the issue of whether the fence at issue in this case was constructed solely for the purpose of harassing or annoying the Tarltons.\u201d The Tarltons argued that the evidence, although arguably prejudicial, was not unfairly prejudicial to the Kaufmans. The District Court granted the Kaufmans\u2019 motion to exclude the introduction of any evidence that the fence violated a county ordinance, was unpermitted, or was illegal.\n\u00b614 The third motion in contention on appeal is a pre-trial motion filed by the Tarltons requesting a jury view of the properties. The Tarltons argued to the District Court that any photographs and other evidence depicting the fence would not \u201coffer the best evidence of the situation.\u201d The Kaufmans objected to the Tarltons\u2019 motion for a jury view of the premises, arguing that the evidence sought to be introduced at trial was \u201csufficient for the jurors to resolve the material issues of fact in this case.\u201d The District Court denied the Tarltons\u2019 request for a jury view at the close of the trial after determining that the photographs and other evidence introduced at trial were sufficient.\n\u00b615 Also in contention on appeal is a jury instruction which included the statement, \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d The instruction, proposed by the Kaufmans prior to trial, was strenuously objected to by the Tarltons on the basis that the instruction misstated Montana\u2019s law on nuisance by including limiting language on unsightliness and view obstruction. The Kaufmans, on the other hand, argued that the instruction appropriately reflected Montana law. Ultimately, the District Court adopted the Kaufmans\u2019 proposed instruction with the limiting language as Instruction 13, adding only the word \u201cgenerally\u201d before the statement, \u201c[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d In addition to the instruction for the Tarltons\u2019 nuisance claim, the District Court also gave instructions for the spite fence claim and for the Kaufmans\u2019 nuisance claim against the Tartlons regarding the lights.\n\u00b616 Following a three-day trial, the jury unanimously found that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was not a nuisance or a spite fence, that the Kaufmans were not required to remove the fence, and that the Tarltons\u2019 lights were not a nuisance. The jury foreperson included a statement at the end of the special verdict form, which stated:\nAlthough we did not find legal grounds to find the fence or the lights a nuisance, we the jury strongly and unanimously recommend the following:\n1) The Tarlton\u2019s [sic] should replace the mercury vapor lights with modernized lights satisfactory to both parties; AND THEN\n2) The Kaufman\u2019s [sic] take their fence down.\n\u00b617 Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the Tarltons filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment or Alternatively, Motion for New Trial, which the District Court denied on September 4, 2007. In denying this motion, the District Court stated, \u201c[t]here are no reasonable grounds for taking the case from the jury and deciding it as a matter of law.\u201d The Tarltons appeal.\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b618 I. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury that \u201c[glenerally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d\n\u00b619 A district court has broad discretion to determine whether to give or refuse a party\u2019s proposed jury instruction, and this Court will not overturn a district court on the basis of an alleged instructional error absent an abuse of discretion. Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, 1999 MT 77, \u00b6 8,294 Mont. 76, \u00b6 8, 979 P.2d 1275, \u00b6 8. The test for abuse of discretion \u201cis whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d Kiely Constr. L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, 2002 MT 241, \u00b6 92,312 Mont. 52, \u00b6 92,57 P.3d 836, \u00b6 92. In reviewing whether a particular instruction was properly given, \u201cwe consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial.\u201d Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, 2007 MT 140, \u00b6 74, 337 Mont. 411, \u00b6 74, 162 P.3d 106, \u00b6 74. Further, \u201cthe party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case.\u201d Murphy Homes, Inc., \u00b6 74. Finally, while a district court has broad discretion to formulate jury instructions, \u201cthat discretion is limited by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d State v. Miller, 2008 MT 106, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 11, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 11.\n\u00b620 Prior to trial, the Kaufmans proposed numerous instructions to the District Court, including specific instructions on the nuisance and spite fence claims. The Kaufmans proposed instruction for the Tarltons\u2019 nuisance claim with respect to the fence stated the following:\nThe plaintiffs in this case have alleged that the defendants\u2019 fence constitutes a nuisance. A structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\nWith this in mind, in order to prevail on their nuisance claim, the plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, all of the following:\n1. That the plaintiffs are the owners of the property upon which they reside;\n2. That the defendants, by building the fence, created a condition that was:\na. Injurious to the health, or\nb. Indecent or offensive to the senses, or\nc. An obstruction to the free use of property.\n3. That the fence caused a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property;\n4. That the plaintiffs have been harmed as a result of the fence and suffered damages.\nThe Kaufmans argued to the District Court that \u201ca simple statement of the statutory definition [of nuisance] would not provide jurors with an accurate and complete statement of the law\u201d and that, therefore, it was necessary for the District Court to include the statement that \u201c[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d\n\u00b621 The Tarltons objected to the Kaufmans\u2019 proposed instruction, arguing to the District Court that the instruction for nuisance should be limited to the plain language of the statute. They stated that \u201cthe problem with [the Kaufmans\u2019] theory ... is that they are relying on California law (which does not actually say what [the Kaufmans] are representing, and which has a much higher population and much higher density of building than does Montana).\u201d Ultimately, the District Court adopted, nearly verbatim, the Kaufmans\u2019 proposed instruction on nuisance as Instruction 13, adding only the word \u201cgenerally\u201d to the statement that, \u201c[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d\n\u00b622 On appeal, the Tarltons argue that the District Court erred by including the additional language regarding unsightliness and view obstruction. The Tarltons claim that this portion of the instruction is contrary to Montana\u2019s definition of nuisance, which provides that \u201c[a]nything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... is a nuisance.\u201d Section 27-30-101(1), MCA. The Tarltons claim that Instruction 13 \u201cis problematic because it require[d] the jury to apply a legal standard that is not a Montana legal standard,\u201d and further, that the jury should have \u201csimply been instructed on Montana\u2019s nuisance law as set forth in \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA.\u201d Finally, the Tarltons claim that \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018anything* by the Montana Legislature means what it says-anything.\u201d Therefore, according to the Tarltons, the definition could \u201cinclude an eyesore (such as the Kaufmans\u2019 fence) or destruction of a person\u2019s enjoyment of the view of public land (such as the Tarltons\u2019 view of the Lolo Peak area and the Lolo Creek drainage).\u201d Based on this alleged instructional error, the Tarltons ask this Court to reverse the judgment and grant a new trial in this case.\n\u00b623 The Kaufmans reiterate on appeal that Instruction 13 \u201ccorrectly instructed the jury on the Montana law of private nuisance in the context of claims based upon obstruction of view or aesthetic considerations.\u201d The Kaufmans also state that Instruction 13 is \u201cboth consistent with Montana\u2019s statutory definition of nuisance and applicable case law interpreting that definition.\u201d The Kaufmans argue that it is proper for this Court to look to California\u2019s pattern jury instructions for guidance on this issue and to California\u2019s case law interpreting \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, given that Montana\u2019s definition of nuisance is modeled after, and nearly identical with, California\u2019s definition of nuisance. See Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a7 3479 (2008).\n\u00b624 After reviewing the arguments in this case, we conclude that Instruction 13 improperly limited the definition of nuisance in Montana. Importantly, there is no relevant statutory authority in Montana for including the statement that \u201c[glenerally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d Montana\u2019s definition of nuisance, which applies to both public and private nuisance claims, states clearly that \u201c[ajnything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... is a nuisance.\u201d Section 27-30-101(1), MCA. Except for limitations on farming operations and activities authorized by statute, the additional nuisance statutes set forth in Chapter 30 of the Montana Code Annotated do not provide further limitations on what may or may not constitute a nuisance in Montana. See Sections 27-30-101(2) through -(3), MCA.\n\u00b625 The Kaufmans cite this Court\u2019s decisions in Barnes v. City of Thompson Falls, 1999 MT 77, 294 Mont. 76, 979 P.2d 1275, Belue v. State, 199 Mont. 451, 649 P.2d 752 (1982), and McCollum v. Kolokotrones, 131 Mont. 438, 311 P.2d 780 (1957), in support of their argument that the District Court correctly instructed the jury on the nuisance claim. Barnes, however, is not applicable to the facts of the present case. In Barnes, we dealt with whether a statutorily authorized sewer and storm drain system installed by the City of Thompson Falls constituted a nuisance under \u00a7 27-30-101(2). Belue, a similar case relied on by the Kaufmans, is also not applicable to the facts of the present case. In Belue, we addressed whether a slag pile that had been in an area for a number of years constituted a public or private nuisance. In neither Barnes nor Belue did we address the question of whether a fence\u2019s (or similar structure\u2019s) unsightliness or view obstruction could or could not be factors of a nuisance claim in Montana. Finally, the Kaufmans\u2019 reliance on our decision in McCollum is also inapposite. The Kaufmans rely heavily on our decision in McCollum for the proposition that \u201ca structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly ....\u201d In support of their argument, the Kaufmans point to our statement in McCollum that \u201cevidence as to the unsightly condition of the premises or structures would not alone make the condition a public nuisance.\u201d McCollum, 131 Mont. at 444, 311 P.2d at 783 (citing People v. Oliver, 86 Cal. App. 2d 885, 195 P.2d 926, 928 (1948)). However, McCollum is distinguishable from the present case, especially with respect to the question of unsightliness.\n\u00b626 In McCollum, we evaluated whether \u201ccertain wooden [chicken] coops, pens, roosts, structures and fences\u201d constituted a public nuisance. Specifically, the plaintiff in McCollum complained about the noise, smells, and cleanliness associated with the chicken coops and argued that the structures were a fire hazard as well as unsightly. The plaintiffs primary argument was that the chicken coops were constructed without a permit in violation of a city ordinance and that such a violation constituted a nuisance per se. Ultimately, we held that the chicken coops did not constitute a public nuisance. However, our holding was primarily based upon our determination that a violation of a municipal ordinance generally does not constitute a nuisance per se or a public nuisance. Furthermore, the structures in McCollum were not unusual in their size or composition, and the plaintiffs argument was based largely on the smells, noise, dust, and insects associated with the chicken coops. The plaintiff did not make any allegation of view obstruction. Here, however, the structure complained of is a massive fence, approximately 26 feet in height, which is covered in dark material. Further, our statement about unsightliness in McCollum did not address the question of whether unsightliness and view obstruction (or unsightliness in combination with any additional factor(s)), could constitute a nuisance in Montana. In the absence of any factually relevant case law in support of limiting nuisance on the basis of both unsightliness and view obstruction, and in light of Montana\u2019s expansive statutory definition of nuisance, we conclude that the limitations on unsightliness and view obstruction articulated in Instruction 13 were inaccurate statements of Montana law.\n\u00b627 The Kaufmans also cite our decisions in Barnes, Belue, and McCollum in support of the claim that this Court has looked to California to interpret Montana\u2019s law on nuisance, and that courts in California have stated that nuisance claims cannot rest solely on view and aesthetic considerations. See Venuto v. Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., 22 Cal. App. 3d 116, 127, 99 Cal. Rptr. 350, 357 (1971) (stating the general proposition that \u201ca building or structure cannot be complained of as a nuisance merely because it obstructs the view from neighboring property\u2019); see also Oliver v. AT&T Wireless Services, 76 Cal. App. 4th 521, 535, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 491, 501 (1999) (stating that \u201cthe size and shape of a neighboring structure that does not obstruct the view and is otherwise permitted by law, however displeasing its appearance, cannot constitute a nuisance.\u201d). Therefore, according to the Kaufmans, the limiting language on view and aesthetic considerations was an accurate statement of the law. However, this discussion does not require an investigation of California nuisance law since our analysis considers only the question of whether the District Court fully and fairly instructed the jury on Montana\u2019s nuisance law. Since the Montana Legislature has not narrowed the definition of what constitutes a nuisance, we are not at liberty to do so here.\n\u00b628 Also, despite the Kaufmans\u2019 argument to the contrary, we do not agree that Instruction 13 was proper due, in part, to its basis on California\u2019s pattern jury instruction. Notably, a review of California\u2019s pattern jury instruction for private nuisance makes clear that it does not include a limitation on unsightliness or view obstruction. See Jud. Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instr. 2021 (rev. Feb. 2007). The text of the pattern instruction generally mirrors California\u2019s statutory definition of nuisance, which, as noted earlier, is nearly identical to Montana\u2019s definition of nuisance found in \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, but the instruction does not limit what may constitute a nuisance in California or include the statement that \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d Presumably, the limiting language was not included in the text of the pattern instruction because to do so, as we note later in this discussion, would be confusing to a jury given the broad definition of nuisance in California.\n\u00b629 Furthermore, Instruction 13, when viewed in its entirety, is internally inconsistent. The second sentence stating that \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view\u201d stands in direct contrast with the broad language of \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA. We find this to have been both misleading and confusing to the jury. The limitation on unsightliness and view obstruction appears to limit what could constitute a nuisance under the language in subpart 2 of Instruction 13, which required the jury to find that the Kaufmans, by building the fence, created a condition that was either injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property. At trial, the Kaufmans\u2019 attorney even admitted that the fence \u201cis not attractive\u201d and that the \u201cfence partially blocks [the Tarltons\u2019] view.\u201d Based on this statement, the jury could have found that the fence was \u201cindecent or offensive to the senses\u201d but were precluded from doing so by the limiting language set forth in the first half of Instruction 13. Additional statements made by the Kaufmans\u2019 attorney during closing arguments also contributed to the confusion in this case. Of particular note is the following statement: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the fence isn\u2019t nice to look at. I\u2019m not surprised they don\u2019t like looking at it. And there\u2019s no doubt that it blocks a portion of their view. Those don\u2019t constitute nuisances.\u201d When these contentions were objected to, the District Court invited the jury to \u201clook at the instructions.\u201d In this case, the jury instruction\u2019s internal inconsistencies made it difficult for the jury to scrutinize whether these statements were accurate representations of Montana\u2019s law on nuisance.\n\u00b630 Lastly, Instruction 13 was prejudicial to the Tarltons. The wording of Instruction 13 clearly emphasized the limitation on unsightliness and view obstruction in the first half of the instruction, which we have determined improperly limited the definition of nuisance in Montana. Given these considerations, Instruction 13 did not fully and fairly instruct the jury, and, consequently, the District Court erred in including the limiting language on unsightliness and view obstruction in Instruction 13.\n\u00b631 II. Did the District Court err by dismissing Count II of the Tarltons\u2019 complaint, which sought a declaration from the District Court that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence?\n\u00b632 The decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory judgment is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Assn. of Counties, 2000 MT 256, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 8, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 8. Further, \u201c[w]hen a district court determines that declaratory relief is not necessary or proper, we will not disturb the court\u2019s ruling absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Northfield, \u00b6 8. However, this Court will \u201creview the conclusions upon which that decision is based to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d Northfield, \u00b6 8.\n\u00b633 The Montana Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) provides that:\nAny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\nSection 27-8-202, MCA. The stated purpose of the Act is \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations and it is to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. However, we have stated that \u201c[a] declaratory proceeding is primarily intended to determine the meaning of a law or a contract and to adjudicate the rights of the parties therein, but not to determine controversial issues of fact such as the existence or denial of procedural due process ....\u2019\u2019Raynes v. City of Great Falls, 215 Mont. 114, 120-21, 696 P.2d 423, 427 (1985); see also 22A Am. Jur. 2d Declaratory Judgments \u00a7 28 (2003) (stating that \u201cdeclaratory decree statutes are not designed for the purpose of establishing purely factual issues, such as the existence or denial of due process, and are not available where the object of the proceedings is to try such fact as a determinative issue rather than to seek a construction of definite stated rights, status, and other relations.\u201d).\n\u00b634 In this case, the Tarltons claim that the District Court erred by dismissing Count II of their complaint, which sought a declaration from the District Court that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence. Before the District Court, the Tarltons stated that they simply wanted the District Court \u201cto declare their rights, to declare that the fence is a spite fence, and to declare that the fence needs to be removed.\u201d The Tarltons even went so far as to base their claim for declaratory relief in Article II, Section III of the Montana Constitution, which provides that Montanans have the right to a clean and healthful environment. Specifically, the Tarltons argue that their \u201crights and use and enjoyment of their property are constitutional and the Kaufmans have interfered with their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\u00b635 However, we agree with the District Court\u2019s statements that \u201c[w]hether the fence is a spite fence involves numerous disputed questions of fact, which are properly the subject of trial on the merits\u201d and that \u201c[djeclaratory relief is not available where the object of the proceeding is to try such a fact as a determinative issue rather than to seek a construction of definite stated rights, status and other relations.\u201d The resolution of this case necessarily required a factual determination of whether the fence was a spite fence. We stated that a spite fence is one that serves \u201cno beneficial use or pleasure to the owner but was erected and is maintained for the purpose of annoying a neighbor.\u201d Haugen v. Kottas, 2001 MT 274, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 301, \u00b6 15, P.3d 672, \u00b6 15 (citing 1 Am. Jur. 2d. Adjoining Landowners \u00a7 106). It is clear that, in this case, it would have been improper for the District Court to declare that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence since the question of whether the fence failed to serve any beneficial use or pleasure to the Kaufmans or that the fence was erected and maintained to annoy the Tarltons were questions of fact appropriate for a trial on the merits. Further, the decision to dismiss the Tartlons\u2019 request for declaratory judgment was within the sound discretion of the District Court. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err by dismissing Count II of the Tarltons\u2019 complaint for declaratory judgment. Since we find that the District Court properly granted the Kaufmans\u2019 motion to dismiss, we do not address whether the Tarltons were entitled to attorney fees under the Act.\n\u00b636 III. Did the District Court err by excluding evidence that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence allegedly violated a local building code or by denying the Tarltons\u2019 request for a jury view of the properties?\n\u00b637 A district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Kiely Constr. L.L.C., \u00b6 92. Accordingly, we review a district court's evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. Kiely Constr. L.L.C., \u00b6 92.\n\u00b638 The Tarltons argue that the District Court erred by refusing to admit evidence that the fence violated Missoula County building codes. Specifically, the Tarltons sought to introduce evidence that Missoula County sent the Kaufmans letters informing them that the fence violated Missoula County building codes. Furthermore, the Tarltons sought to introduce testimony from the county building inspector that the \u201cfence would require significant engineering to establish its structural integrity.\u201d This evidence, the Tarltons contend, could demonstrate to the jury that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a spite fence and built without regard to the necessary permitting processes that are meant to precede construction of certain structures. The Kaufmans, however, argue that they were initially not aware of the permitting process or building codes and that they took the necessary steps to secure a permit for the fence as soon as they became aware of the building codes.\n\u00b639 In denying the introduction of the evidence, the District Court determined that the evidence, although relevant, was not probative of the central issues in the case and that it would likely lead to unnecessary confusion. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence violated, for at least a certain time period, the local building codes. The determination that such evidence would have the tendency to confuse the jury was within the sound discretion of the District Court, and consistent with M. R. Evid. 403, which states, \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Notably, the District Court also excluded evidence that the Kaufmans ultimately secured a permit for the fence. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err by excluding evidence of whether the fence violated local building codes.\n\u00b640 With respect to the District Court\u2019s decision to deny a jury view of the property, we note that such a decision is also left to the sound discretion of the trial court. See McJunkin v. Kaufman & Broad Home Sys., 229 Mont. 432, 446, 748 P.2d 910, 919 (1987). Section 25-7-401, MCA, provides, in relevant part, \u201c[w]hen in the opinion of the Court, it is proper for the jury to have a view of the property which is the subject of the litigation ... it may order the jurors to be conducted in a body ... to the place, which shall be shown to them by the persons appointed by the court for that purpose.\u201d\n\u00b641 The Tarltons argue that, in order for the jury to make an appropriate determination on whether the Kaufmans\u2019 fence was a nuisance and a spite fence, the \u201cbest evidence is to look at both properties at issue, to view the fence both during the day time and also at night when the yard lights are on so, that the jury can apply the testimony of all witnesses to the conditions that the parties are alleging and so that they can determine the truth of statements made by these witnesses with regard to those conditions.\u201d In general, the Tarltons argue that the photographs, diagrams, and other visual media used at trial were insufficient to establish the true character of either the fence or the view it obstructs. The Kaufmans, in objecting to the Tarltons\u2019 motion for a jury view, argued that it \u201cwould be impractical, add to the costs of the litigation and would be unfair because the material conditions of the property had changed significantly since the lawsuit had been filed.\u201d\n\u00b642 In this case, the District Court ultimately denied the Tarltons\u2019 motion for a jury view. In reaching this decision, the District Court appropriately weighed both the practical implications and the likely probative value of a jury view. The District Court also waited to make a determination on whether to allow the jury view until near the close of the trial. Only then did the District Court, after reviewing the sufficiency of the photographs and other evidence presented in the case, determine that a jury view was unnecessary. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err by denying a jury view of the property.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b643 In sum, the District Court erred by instructing the jury that \u201c[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d This instruction improperly limited the definition of nuisance set forth in \u00a7 27-30-101(1), MCA, and, when viewed in its entirety, was misleading and confusing to the jury. The District Court, however, did not err by dismissing the Tarltons\u2019 claim for declaratory judgment. Finally, the District Court did not err by excluding evidence of whether the fence violated local building codes or by denying a jury view of the property in this case. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.", "type": "majority", "author": "JUSTICE LEAPHART"}, {"text": "JUSTICE MORRIS\ndissents.\n\u00b644 \u201cGood fences make good neighbors,\u201d wrote American poet Robert Frost from his perspective in rural New England in the early twentieth century. Frost gave voice to the longstanding human urge \u201cto be let alone.\u201d See Samuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 193 (1890) (noting that the traditional common law right to life and property had developed to encompass a broader \u201cright to be let alone\u201d that included recognition of \u201cintangible\u201d interests). Common sense dictated that minding your own business would be easier if barriers clearly demarcated the boundaries of your business.\n\u00b645 Frost likely never imagined how his homespun aphorism would mutate in rural Montana of the early twenty-first century. The yearning to be let alone now confront mercury vapor lighting and industrial strength fencing that would make proud the wall builders of Berlin. Walden Pond it is not. Frost would take heart, however, from the similar common sense displayed by the jury in this matter. The jury recommended that the Tarltons should replace the offending 175 watt mercury vapor lights, known as \u201cbarn beacons,\u201d with modernized lights and that the Kaufmans, in turn, should \u201ctake down their fence.\u201d\n\u00b646 The jury\u2019s plea for common sense fell on deaf ears. Instead the parties engaged in a modern form of the \u201cprisoner\u2019s dilemma.\u201d The Tarltons had no guarantee that any efforts to modernize the lighting would lead to the Kaufmans removing the fence. On the other hand, the Kaufmans had no guarantee that a good faith gesture on their part of removing the fence first would be greeted with a decision by the Tarltons to remove the \u201cbarn beacons.\u201d The parties sought judicial resolution of their dispute.\n\u00b647 The parties spent three days presenting their cases to the jury. The parties, not surprisingly, haggled over the proper instruction of nuisance to be given to the jury. The jury returned a verdict that the fence did not constitute a nuisance. The jury conversely determined that the Tarltons\u2019 mercury vapor lighting did not constitute a nuisance. The jury finally determined that the Kaufmans\u2019 fence did not qualify as a \u201cspite fence\u201d under the circumstances presented here. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to defer to the jury\u2019s reasoned judgment.\n\u00b648 As the Court notes, we must \u201c\u2018consider the jury instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial.\u2019\u201d (quoting Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, 2007 MT140, \u00b6 74, 337 Mont. 411, \u00b6 74, 162 P.3d 106, \u00b6 74). The jury instructions in this matter included an instruction for nuisance on the fence, and instruction for nuisance on the mercury vapor lighting, and an instruction for a \u201cspite fence.\u201d The Court must consider the separate nuisance instructions and the \u201cspite fence\u201d instructions together in evaluating whether the jury instructions, in their entirety, correctly stated the law. Murphy Homes, Inc., \u00b6 74. We also must remember that the Kaufmans filed a nuisance claim of their own regarding the Tarltons\u2019 mercury vapor lighting.\n\u00b649 The nuisance instruction relating to the fence contained the admonition that \u201c[generally, a structure cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party\u2019s view.\u201d The instruction proceeded to set forth the elements for a nuisance claim. The Tarltons objected only to the admonitory language and raised no concern with the remainder of the instruction.\n\u00b650 The District Court instructed the jury on the Kaufmans\u2019 nuisance claim in a manner nearly identical to the Tarltons\u2019 nuisance claim with one exception. The jury instruction on the Tarltons\u2019 nuisance claim contained the admonitory \u201cgenerally\u201d provision. The jury instruction on the Kaufmans\u2019 nuisance claim instead provided in its introductory paragraph that light shining on another\u2019s property \u201cmay constitute a nuisance where the intensity of the light is strong enough to seriously disturb a person of normal sensitivities.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\u00b651 The District Court balanced its admonitory language regarding \u201cgenerally\u201d in the nuisance instruction regarding the fence with the provision that the jury could not consider the Tarltons\u2019 mercury vapor lighting to constitute a nuisance unless the lights \u201cseriously\u201d disturbed the Kaufmans\u2019 enjoyment of their property. Nothing in Montana\u2019s statutory definition of nuisance, set forth in \u00a7 27-30-101, MCA, limits a nuisance to those things that \u201cseriously\u201d disturb a person\u2019s enjoyment of their property. Likewise, nothing in California\u2019s pattern jury instruction for private nuisance limits a nuisance to those things that \u201cseriously\u201d disturb a person\u2019s enjoyment of their property. Jud. Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instr. 2021 (rev. Feb. 2007).\n\u00b652 The District Court\u2019s jury instructions on the Tarltons\u2019 \u201cspite fence\u201d claim provided further context. These instructions provided first that no property owner has the right \u201cto erect and maintain an otherwise useless structure for the sole purpose of injuring his neighbor.\u201d The \u201cspite fence\u201d instruction further provided that a \u201cspite fence\u201d is \u201cof no beneficial use\u201d to the party and that the party built the \u201cspite fence\u201d \u201csolely to harass and anno/\u2019 their neighbors.\n\u00b653 The jury rejected the Tarltons\u2019 \u201cspite fence\u201d claim and in doing so, rejected the notion that the Kauffman\u2019s fence constituted an \u201cotherwise useless structure.\u201d The jury also explicitly rejected the contention that the Kaufmans had built the fence \u201cfor the sole purpose\u201d of harassing and annoying the Tarltons. As implied by the jury\u2019s verdict, and made explicit by the jury\u2019s recommendation, the jury determined that the Kaufmans had built the fence to block the light emitting from the Tarltons\u2019 mercury vapor lights.\n\u00b654 In the context of the evidence presented to the jury in this case, the District Court did not act arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed the bounds of reason when it included the admonitory \u201cgenerally\u201d language in the jury instruction on the Tarltons\u2019 nuisance claim.

I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the jury instructions, taken in their entirety, did not state the law of nuisance fully and fairly. Murphy Homes, Inc., \u00b6 74.
