    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[84,432,1324,287]]]'>¶1 Robert Rose appeals from his 2003 convictions for aggravated kidnapping, assault with a weapon and assault on a peace officer. Rose was found guilty by a jury and judgment entered on June 6, 2003. He appealed and this Court remanded to the District Court to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the denial of Rose’s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[84,728,1325,239]]]'>¶2 After remand, the District Court held a two day evidentiary hearing on Rose’s speedy trial claim and subsequently entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order again denying his motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. We restate and consider the several issues Rose raises on appeal as follows:</p>
    <p id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[83,976,1324,90]]]'>¶3 1) Did the District Court err in denying Rose’s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</p>
    <p id="b315-9" data-blocks='[["BL_315.9",315,[84,1074,1324,90]]]'>¶4 2) Did the District Court err when it failed to hold a hearing on Rose’s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>
    <p id="b315-10" data-blocks='[["BL_315.10",315,[83,1173,1325,180]]]'>¶5 3) Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Rose’s motion for a new trial on the basis that the prosecutor’s statements during the State’s closing argument denied Rose a fair and impartial trial?</p>
    <p id="b315-11" data-blocks='[["BL_315.11",315,[83,1371,1321,89]]]'>¶6 4) Was Rose’s trial counsel ineffective before she was removed, thus requiring a mistrial?</p>

    <p id="b315-13" data-blocks='[["BL_315.13",315,[82,1568,1326,384]]]'>¶7 Rose was arrested on January 11, 2002, in Ravalli County following an incident in which he kidnapped a friend and co-worker, Jonathan Kirk Davies at knife point, badly cutting Davies when he tried to escape. Both Rose and Davies required medical attention. Later, upon his release from the hospital, Rose obtained pepper spray inadvertently left in the back of a patrol car and sprayed a law enforcement officer with it when in the Ravalli County Detention Facility.</p>
    <p id="b315-14" data-blocks='[["BL_315.14",315,[82,1962,1324,240]]]'>¶8 The odyssey which occurred between Rose’s arrest on January 11, 2002, and his eventual trial which commenced 507 days later, on June 2, 2003, is summarized here as it relates to Rose’s claim that he was denied a speedy trial and his claim that he was denied a hearing to address his complaints about his lawyers.</p>
    <p id="b315-15" data-blocks='[["BL_315.15",315,[81,2210,1325,140]],["BL_316.1",316,[173,328,1319,90]]]'>¶9 The day after his arrest on January 11, a complaint was filed in the Ravalli County Justice Court charging Rose with aggravated kidnapping, assault with a weapon and assault on a peace officer. On <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>January 23, the State filed an information charging Rose with these same felony offenses in District Court.</p>
    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[172,426,1324,682]]]'>¶10 On February 6, Rose made his initial appearance in District Court with court-appointed counsel, Larry Mansch. When asked if the defense needed further time to enter a plea, Mansch said, “We do, your Honor. We received about 160-some pages of discovery just the other day, and I know that Robert would like more time to review that, so we’d like to reappear next Wednesday, if I could, please.” On Wednesday, February 13, Rose appeared with counsel and entered not guilty pleas. The District Court set an Omnibus Hearing for March 6. At the Omnibus hearing, defense counsel noted Rose’s desire to move for a change of venue, and asked for additional time to pursue that option. The court gave the defense until March 27, 2002, to file the motion and stated: “Then it will be on the standard schedule.” The court set a status conference for April 10 and a settlement conference for April 18, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[172,1115,1323,334]]]'>¶11 At the April 10 status hearing, Rose appeared with counsel and requested a continuance of the April 18 settlement conference. The State, represented by Ravalli County Attorney George H. Corn, objected. Corn predicted that Rose would later raise speedy trial problems and requested to proceed to trial with all haste. The District Court granted Rose’s motion to postpone the settlement conference until May 2, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[172,1457,1323,387]]]'>¶12 On April 17, the District Court received the first of several letters from Rose complaining about his legal representation by Mansch. On April 18, the District Court scheduled a special hearing for April 24 to inquire about Rose’s complaints. The day before the hearing, the court received another letter from Rose, retracting his complaints against Mansch. Rose then appeared at the hearing on April 24 along with Mansch. He personally advised the court that he was satisfied with his counsel and there was no need for a further hearing on the matter.</p>
    <p id="AQF" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[172,1853,1323,279]]]'>¶13 On May 6, the court received another letter from Rose saying he regretted stating in court that he was satisfied with Mansch. On May 30, Mansch, who received Rose’s letters only after the court forwarded copies of them to him, wrote the court saying Rose’s letters to the court had not affected his representation and he was unwilling to step down from the case.</p>
    <p id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.8",316,[172,2147,1323,191]]]'>¶14 On June 6, Rose sent another letter to the court saying he was far from happy or satisfied with Mansch’s assistance. Rose also asked to represent himself <em>pro se </em>until he could retain private counsel or until he was appointed different counsel.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.3",317,[71,327,1325,633]]]'>
      <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>¶15 At a status hearing on June 12, Mansch told the court that Rose’s letters to the court had not compromised his representation of Rose. The State, again desiring the proper procedure be followed concerning Rose’s off again on again complaints about his lawyer and wishing to avoid speedy trial issues, asked the District Court to inquire about the letters written by Rose complaining about his lawyer, and noted that the trial was set to take place in less than two months. The judge asked Rose to state the reasons why he was dissatisfied with Mansch’s representation and explained that only then could the court determine if there was a substantial basis for Rose’s dissatisfaction. The judge explained that only if there was a valid basis for Rose’s complaints, would the court hold a full hearing to determine if Mansch should be replaced. The following exchange then took place:</p>
    <blockquote id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[161,969,1234,180]]]'>Rose: Your Honor, I was wondering if we could maybe postpone this issue until a further time when we can meet with Mr. Corn and discuss some things, and if I still feel there’s a problem, could I address the Court at that time.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[161,1166,1234,190]]]'>State:... I’ll rearrange my schedule and make sure we get it done. I think I want the record to reflect that this is done on Mr. Rose’s request. There could be a speedy trial issue, and I don’t want that to be on the State’s hook, so that’s my concern.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[161,1361,1232,94]]]'>Court: So we’ll continue this hearing then -until June 19th at 9:00 on request of the Defendant.</blockquote>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[67,1464,1326,387]]]'>¶16 On June 19, 2002, a status hearing was held at which Corn said that the State would press ahead and assumed the trial would be held on July 31. By that time, Rose had sent yet another letter to the court regarding Mansch’s representation. The State asked that Rose decide whether or not he wanted to proceed with Mr. Mansch, noting he signed no waiver of a speedy trial. The judge asked Rose if it was his wish to have a different attorney, Rose replied, ‘Yes, I think I would, because things have not run smoothly.”</p>
    <p id="b317-8" data-blocks='[["BL_317.8",317,[66,1859,1327,386]]]'>¶17 The District Court specifically told Rose that if a new attorney was assigned to represent him, it would mean the trial would probably be postponed for weeks or even months. Mansch noted that Rose continuously complained about his representation and indicated his willingness to step aside. The District Court, noting it would save time, dismissed Mansch and appointed another attorney, Mr. Dustin Gahagan to represent Rose. The prosecutor, Mr. Corn, made no objection, noting the trial was still scheduled for July 29.</p>
    <p id="b317-9" data-blocks='[["BL_317.9",317,[68,2252,1324,91]],["BL_318.1",318,[186,320,1322,339]]]'>¶18 On July 11, 2002, the defense filed a motion to continue the July 29 trial. Attached to the motion was a handwritten waiver of speedy <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>trial signed by Rose. Reasons cited for requesting the continuance were counsel Gahagan had not been on the case very long, was extremely busy, and needed additional time to prepare the defense. Rose sent a letter to the District Court on July 13,2002, requesting postponement of the July trial saying he had hoped not to have to waive his right to a speedy trial but due to the lack of preparation by present counsel, he was left with no other option.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[187,667,1323,284]]]'>¶19 Six days later, Gahagan moved to substitute a different attorney as counsel for Rose due to the change in the public defender contract with Ravalli County. On July 22, 2002, the District Court appointed Kelli Sather as Rose’s attorney. The District Court granted Rose’s motion for further delay caused by his request for a different lawyer and reset the trial for November 18, 2002.</p>
    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[186,961,1324,731]]]'>¶20 On October 25, 2002, less than one month before the November trial date, the defense filed a motion for a psychological exam. Three days later, the State filed a motion requesting that the trial proceed as scheduled on November 18. That same day, Rose appeared in court with Sather. Rose told the court he was interested in proceeding <em>pro se </em>but did not have a chance to talk to counsel about it enough yet. Sather reiterated the request for a psychological evaluation. The State reiterated its request that trial proceed as scheduled and any delay be attributed to the defense. The court advised Rose an evaluation would further delay trial and asked if he understood. Rose advised the court he understood. The court granted the motion for a psychological evaluation and advised a new trial date would be set after the evaluation was received. Rose requested to proceed <em>pro se </em>with consultation from Sather and the court postponed any decision on that matter until completion of the psychological examination.</p>
    <p id="b318-6" data-blocks='[["BL_318.6",318,[186,1701,1324,428]]]'>¶21 On January 31, 2003, Rose wrote to the court requesting a hearing about his complaints about his attorney. On February 12, 2003, Rose appeared with Sather. The District Court inquired about both the status of the psychological examination and Rose’s complaints about his attorney. Sather stated the examination was finished and the doctor reported Rose was competent to proceed to trial. Sather further advised that Rose had not yet decided whether he wanted to rely on the psychological evaluation at trial, which would require him to disclose it to the State.</p>
    <p id="b318-7" data-blocks='[["BL_318.7",318,[188,2145,1321,89]]]'>¶22 The court then inquired about Rose’s complaints with his representation by Sather as follows:</p>

We met Monday, as she said, and I feel there’s been some confidence restored there, but as I mentioned in my complaint, I felt there’s been some due process violations and I would like to make mention of, if the Court would allow me time. If not we can-. Court: You can’t have an attorney and represent yourself at the same time, Mr. Rose. If you want to represent yourself, we can discuss that. If you want to be represented by an attorney, you need to deal with her and she will evaluate your claims and proceed with what she thinks is valid.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[167,772,225,40]]]'>Rose: Okay.</blockquote>

I do not have a complaint with her. I told her that. I felt it was a conflict rather with the State of Montana and Ravalli County and providing me with counsel that’s real busy, and that’s been the issue, and I feel that’s where my conflict lies.</blockquote>

I just wanted to remind the Court that these were the same complaints the Court has heard from Mr. Mansch last May, June and July. Mr. Mansch was ultimately relieved. The Court attempted to address Mr. Rose’s concerns, and it seems like we’re back to the same spot as eight months before. The matter has been set for trial twice. Witnesses have been subpoenaed, interviewed. I think that I’d respectfully request the Court impose some deadlines, not too quick, since we have witnesses out of town, but it sounds like Mr. Rose is heading down the same path. He’s going to attempt to fire present counsel, would be my prediction, so I would ask that the Court put some deadlines. It would take us probably a month to five weeks, just because we have witnesses that are out of the county that we have gone through the process of contacting and lining up before, but I think the deadlines are necessary, given the history of the case.

When he again complained about his representation, the District Court carefully explained to Rose that if he wanted new counsel it would cause a delay. Rose accepted the delay and went so far to file a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Then, after new counsel had time to prepare, and shortly before the trial was set, Rose filed a new request for further delay to advance a new defense, and then again complained about his lawyer’s representation. Based on this record, we conclude it was Rose who caused the greater portion of the delay in bringing this case to trial.</p>

But the 104-day delay between January 11 (Rose’s arrest) and April 25 is another matter. Again, the primary burden to assure that cases are <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>brought to trial is on the courts and the prosecutors, and the trial court itself has an “ ‘affirmative constitutional obligation’ ” to make a good faith, diligent effort to bring the defendant to trial quickly. <em>Ariegwe, </em>¶¶ 65, 72. Given these constitutional mandates, there is simply no justification for a trial court’s failing to select a trial date at the earliest practical opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[169,613,1325,389]]]'>¶134 Notably, in <em>Ariegwe, </em>the district court set trial at Ariegwe’s arraignment. In <em>Billman, </em>the district court issued an order 20 days after Billman’s arraignment scheduling the omnibus hearing and setting a trial date. In this case, however, the District Court did not set trial until well after the omnibus hearing. The State offers no justification for delaying until 50 days after the omnibus hearing and 71 days after Rose’s arraignment to set a trial date which, as noted, was 95 days out.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[172,1010,1322,829]]]'>¶135 Absent exceptional circumstances, a trial court should be able to select a trial date by the time of the omnibus hearing or promptly thereafter. The purpose of this hearing, which is to be held “[w]ithin a reasonable time following the entry of a not guilty plea but not less than 30 days before trial,” is “to expedite the procedures leading up to the trial of the defendant.” Section 46-13-110(1), (2), MCA. At this point in time, the parties should have a good idea of whether a trial is “necessary.” Indeed, § 46-13-110(3), MCA, instructs the prosecutor and defense counsel to be prepared to discuss a number of pretrial matters, including the existence of a plea agreement; reliance on certain defenses; intent to seek persistent felony offender status; intent to rely on evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts; and change of venue. While a “face to face settlement conference” after the omnibus hearing might ultimately resolve the case, that is beside the point. There is always a risk that the case will <em>not </em>be settled, and the speedy trial right prohibits the court from placing that risk on the defendant by refusing to select a trial date until after the conference.</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[172,1848,1322,434]],["BL_343.1",343,[102,320,1325,91]]]'>¶136 Here, on March 6, the District Court required the parties to have a “face to face settlement conference” on April 18 and stated that a trial date would be set thereafter, “if necessary.” While this procedure may have enabled the court to set only “necessary” trial dates, it conflicted with the court’s affirmative constitutional obligation to ensure that criminal defendants are brought to trial expeditiously. Fifty days later, after being apprised by the prosecutor and defense counsel that the case remained unresolved, the court set trial. Presumably, July 29 was the earliest suitable date; however, this does <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>not change the fact that a suitable date roughly 50 days earlier might have been possible had the court not delayed setting Rose’s trial.</p>
    <p id="ALL" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[102,419,1326,585]]]'>¶137 The Court asserts that Rose’s counsel was “unprepared” at the March 6 omnibus hearing and requested additional time to investigate whether he should move for a change of venue. Opinion, ¶ 50. Conspicuously absent from the Court’s discussion, however, is the fact that the prosecutor likewise was “unprepared” and, thus, requested additional time to file his notice under <em>State v.

The District Court gave defense counsel until March 27 to file a change of venue motion and gave the prosecutor until March 29 to file his <em>Just/Matt </em>notice. Nevertheless, the Court assigns 21 days of delay to Rose. Opinion, ¶ 50. This approach is erroneous for two reasons.</p>
    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[101,1014,1326,586]]]'>¶138 First, the District Court’s policy, as stated in the Omnibus Hearing Memorandum, was not to set a trial date until after the settlement conference, which was slated for April 18. Thus, defense counsel’s request for additional time to investigate a change of venue had absolutely no impact on the setting of a trial date in this case. Both his investigation and his motion were to be completed several weeks before the settlement conference was to occur. Consequently, the Court here is doing exactly what we said in <em>Ariegwe </em>a court should not do: “consider any actions taken by the State or the accused which do not result in a postponement of the trial date.” <em>Ariegwe, </em>¶ 63. Defense counsel’s request did not delay Rose’s trial; thus, there is no basis for the Court to assign Rose the 21 days of delay.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[98,1608,1327,629]]]'>¶139 Second, and more to the point, neither Rose’s request for additional time to investigate a change of venue nor the State’s request for additional time to file its <em>Just/Matt </em>notice precluded the District Court from setting a trial date. The record reflects that that a three-to four-month delay between setting a trial date and holding the trial was typical for the District Court during this period. Had the court set trial on March 6 for June 10, instead of setting it on April 25 for July 29, 50 days of delay could have been averted. While this might appear to be speculative, the critical point here is that the State has the burden of justifying the pretrial delays, and that burden in this case is “increased substantially” (Opinion, ¶ 46) due to the extent of the delay. Yet, the State has offered no justification for the District Court’s waiting until April 25 to select a trial date.</p>
    <p id="b343-7" data-blocks='[["BL_343.7",343,[100,2247,1325,94]],["BL_344.1",344,[165,316,1324,686]]]'>¶140 Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the 199-day delay between arrest and the first trial setting is properly attributed <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>as follows. First, from the January 11 arrest to the March 6 omnibus hearing (54 days): Accepting, for the sake of argument, the Court’s assertion that Rose delayed the selection of a trial date by 7 days when he requested time to review discovery before entering his plea (Opinion, ¶ 49), 47 days are attributable to the State as institutional delay and 7 days are attributable to Rose as acceptable delay in preparing his case. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>¶¶ 68-72. Second, from March 7 to April 25 (50 days): Because this delay resulted from the District Court’s decision to postpone setting Rose’s trial date, for which the State has provided no justification, it is attributable to the State and weighted more heavily than unavoidable delay inherent in the criminal justice system. <em>See e.g. Ariegwe, </em>¶¶ 126-128. Lastly, from April 26 to July 29 (95 days): These days are attributable to the State as institutional delay.</p>

The waiver, rather, was intended (as Rose later confirmed in his July 12 letter) to secure a continuance of the July 29 trial date.

If these standards are to have any meaning in our speedy trial framework, I cannot agree with the Court that the 112-day delay between the first and second trial settings should be attributed solely to Rose. Opinion, ¶ 52. The State has the burden to show that that Rose’s “waiver” was made knowingly and voluntarily, but the State has not done so. The State also has the burden to show that postponement of the July 29 trial date was caused by Rose, but the record is ambiguous on this point. The postponement may have been necessitated by institutional changes in the public defender system, by the prosecution’s motion to add 13 new witnesses 21 days before trial, by the replacement of Mansch at Rose’s request about six weeks before trial, or by all of these factors.</p>

Yet, the record in this case does not establish that Rose’s complaints about court-appointed counsel were meritless. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>¶ 24 (observing that Ellenburg’s “meritless” complaints delayed his trial).

At a hearing on October 28, the District Court advised Rose that the trial would have to be rescheduled if an evaluation was conducted. Rose indicated that he understood this. The court then granted the motion. The court stated, however, that a new trial date would not be set until the evaluation was received.</p>

The court reasoned that the time it took to complete the psychological evaluation was Rose’s responsibility and the time between completing the evaluation and trial was the State’s responsibility. The flaw in this reasoning, however, is that these two time periods could have elapsed <em>simultaneously </em>had the court promptly rescheduled trial upon granting Rose’s motion.</p>
    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[173,1062,1322,675]]]'>¶159 The first trial date in this case was set on April 25, 2002, for July 29, 2002 (about three months out); the second trial date was set on July 29,2002, for November 18,2002 (nearly four months out); and the third trial date was set on February 19, 2003, for May 12, 2003 (almost three months out). Thus, on October 28, 2002, when the court granted the Motion for Psychological Examination and vacated the existing trial date, had the court then set a new trial date, the new date likely would have been sometime in February 2003. (Actually, the prosecutor pointed out during the October 28 hearing that “trial dates are already being scheduled in March.”) But that did not occur. Rather, the court stated that “I won’t set [the trial date] until we get the report in.” As a result, there is a significant period of time (October 28, 2002, to February 19, 2003) during which there was no trial date set in this case at all.</p>

As explained above, the trial court shares the duty of assuring that a criminal case is brought to trial expeditiously. This includes maintaining a trial date. Having a pending trial date provides an impetus for the parties to prepare their cases diligently for trial, which in turn lessens the chance of a speedy trial violation. It also creates a favorable situation in which “docket delay” (i.e., delay caused by the reality that trial dates have to be set a number of months in advance) transpires <em>simultaneously </em>with the time required by the parties to prepare their cases.</p>

Had the court, on October 28, 2002, set a trial date for, e.g., March 3, 2003 (about four months out), and had Rose’s counsel requested additional time to review the psychological report (which counsel received during the first week of February 2003), then such delay would have been properly attributed to Rose. But Rose was never even given the opportunity to proceed to trial in early March 2003 because the District Court failed to set a new trial date promptly after it vacated the November 18, 2002 trial date.</p>

Opinion, ¶ 54. Yet, for the reasons just discussed, although Rose’s motion caused the court to vacate the existing trial date, the motion did not in any way preclude the court from promptly setting a new trial date. Rather, the court of its own accord decided to allow four months to pass by without a pending trial date in Rose’s case. Notably, the parties were ready to proceed in mid-February 2003, but they had to wait an additional three months to go to trial due entirely to the District Court’s failure to maintain a trial setting for Rose on the court’s docket.</p>
    <p id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[69,1272,1326,237]]]'>¶163 For these reasons, I conclude that of the 175 days between the second and third trial settings, the 93 days of avoidable delay during which no trial date was set (November 18,2002, to February 19,2003) is attributable to the State and weighs more heavily than institutional delay. The remaining 82 days are attributable to Rose.</p>

Of that, 306 days (60 percent) are attributable to the State as follows: 163 days as institutional delay, and 143 days as avoidable delay in setting trial dates. The remaining 201 days (40 percent) are attributable to Rose due to his trial preparations. Significantly, there is no evidence of stonewalling on the part of the prosecution. Indeed, on a number of occasions, the prosecution expressed concern about the speedy trial issue and objected to postponing the trial date. On the other hand, given the State’s substantially increased burden to justify the delay in this case (Opinion, ¶ 46), and given the amount of delay attributable to the <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>State that could have been avoided, I conclude that Factor Two weighs in Rose’s favor, though only slightly.</p>

    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[190,524,1323,538]]]'>¶166 At the outset, I note the Court’s assertion that “[t]he State’s response to the motions for delay indicates its desire to proceed to trial.” Opinion, ¶ 62. As explained in <em>Ariegwe, </em>however, the critical question under Factor Three is “whether <em>the accused </em>actually wanted to be brought to trial promptly.” <em>Ariegwe, </em>¶ 76 (emphasis added). The State’s desire to proceed to trial has little, if any, relevance to this question. Rather, we must evaluate <em>Rose’s </em>responses to the pretrial delays. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>¶¶ 79-81. Conduct evidencing a desire to be brought to trial promptly weighs in Rose’s favor, whereas conduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against Rose in the overall balancing. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>¶ 85.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[191,1070,1323,584]]]'>¶167 Some of Rose’s pretrial letters suggest ongoing frustration about the pace at which defense counsel was investigating and preparing the defense. Yet, many of Rose’s actions (such as the repeated about-faces concerning Mansch’s representation and the request for a psychological examination in spite of the fact that it would require a trial postponement) suggest that Rose was not overly concerned about the pretrial delays. Likewise, although Rose asserted his right to a speedy trial in a number of court filings beginning in late-February 2003, the sincerity of these assertions is questionable. <em>See </em>Opinion, ¶ 61 (referring to Rose’s assertions as “half-hearted”). Considering the totality of Rose’s conduct, I agree with the Court that Factor Three weighs in favor of the State.</p>

As noted, the State must make a “highly persuasive showing” that Rose was not prejudiced by the delay. Opinion, ¶ 66.</p>

Rose was incarcerated at the Ravalli County Detention Center (RCDC) for the entire 507 days between arrest on January 11, 2002, and trial on June 2, 2003. He spent the first seven months isolated in a maximum security cell. He testified in the District Court (during the speedy trial hearing) that he was not allowed contact with other inmates during this period. He was in his cell for at least 23 hours a day, and some days he was not let out of his cell at all. His only human contact was with the guards when they delivered his meals through a food slot. He ate alone in his cell, which was seven feet wide and approximately ten feet long and had a cement floor, a cement ceiling, cinderblock walls, and a stainless steal toilet and sink. The only window was a four inch by four inch piece of glass in the door.</p>
    <p id="Avb" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[80,1027,1328,585]]]'>¶170 Rose claims he was placed in isolation despite strong indications that he suffered from existing mental health issues including bipolar disorder.

In this connection, Paul Graves, who met with Rose almost weekly as part of the jail ministry, testified that Rose lost around 15 or 20 pounds during his isolation and that the slight limp Rose had when they first met appeared to worsen over this period.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[79,1621,1325,426]]]'>¶171 During the winter months, Rose’s cell was “unbearable” in terms of temperature. Rose testified that there were “times you could see your breath in the cell and there was just no relief.” He was allowed only one blanket and would “shiver all night long.” He also stated that he was threatened with disciplinary action when he plugged a vent that blew cold air into his cell. Cathy Powell, RCDC Commander, acknowledged at the speedy trial hearing that there had been problems with the heating. She testified that these problems have since been remedied.</p>

Yet, even if Rose’s pretrial incarceration was necessitated to an extent by the factors set forth in the bail statute (§ 46-9-301, MCA), nothing about <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>the nature of the charged offenses, Rose’s criminal history, or Rose’s drug history could justify subjecting him for an extended period of time to the conditions discussed above.</p>

He spent the first seven months isolated in a maximum security cell. Considering the duration and conditions of that incarceration, I conclude that the incarceration was oppressive. However, as noted, I agree with the Court that the delay in bringing Rose to trial did not unduly prolong the disruption of his life or aggravate the anxiety and concern inherent in being accused of a crime. Opinion, ¶ 77. Likewise, it does not appear that the delay significantly impaired Rose’s ability to present an effective defense. Opinion, ¶¶ 81-83.

A significant portion of that delay (28 percent) was caused by the District Court’s delay in setting trial dates.

To the contrary, the prosecutor objected to several of the delays in this case. Moreover, Rose is responsible for 40 percent of the delay, and his actions during much of the pretrial period suggest that he was not overly concerned about the delays. Finally, it does not appear that Rose’s ability to present an effective defense was significantly impaired by the delay or that the delay aggravated or unduly prolonged Rose’s anxiety and concern.</p>
