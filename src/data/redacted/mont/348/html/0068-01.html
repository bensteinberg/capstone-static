    <p id="b91-14" data-blocks='[["BL_91.16",91,[82,1598,1330,485]]]'>¶4 St. James Healthcare is a not-for-profit corporation that operates a hospital in Butte. Dr. Jesse Cole has been a member of the Medical Staff at St. James since 1996. The St. James Healthcare Medical Staff Bylaws (“the Bylaws”) require Medical Staff members to apply for reappointment every two years. In 2006, Dr. Cole applied for reappointment. Later that year, St. James obtained a permanent injunction against Dr. Cole, to enjoin him from threatening hospital staff and from contacting potential candidates for the hospital’s radiology department. <em>St. James Healthcare v.

Before the Board could make a decision on Dr. Cole’s application for reappointment, Hecker wrote, it needed “additional information.”</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[169,558,1323,531]]]'>¶6 The Board hired an attorney, Carey Matovich, to conduct an independent investigation (hereinafter “Matovich investigation”). Dr. Cole refused to cooperate with Matovich, because he believed that under Article VII, Part C, he was entitled to an investigation conducted by his peers on the Medical Staff. At the close of her investigation, Matovich recommended that the Board deny Dr. Cole’s application for reappointment. The Board then issued a preliminary decision denying Dr. Cole’s reappointment. The Board notified Dr. Cole of its preliminary decision, and offered him the opportunity to challenge the decision through the hearing and appeals process set forth in Article VIII of the Bylaws.</p>

    <p id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[169,1394,1322,333]]]'>¶8 Dr. Cole also applied for a preliminary injunction, to prevent St. James from taking further adverse action against him, and from making a detrimental report to the National Practitioner’s Database.

In sum, our task in reviewing the District Court’s decision to grant the preliminary injunction against St. James is “not to resolve the substantive matters of law relevant to the ultimate resolution of [the] complaint;” it is to inquire only whether the District Court manifestly abused its discretion by granting the injunction. <em>Benefis Healthcare v.

    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.7",94,[172,1395,1322,284]]]'>¶14 The District Court concluded that Dr. Cole’s application met the requirements of § 27-19-201(1), (2), and (3), MCA, and thus, that a preliminary injunction was appropriate. We have held, however, that the five factors of § 27-19-201, MCA, are disjunctive: the moving party must satisfy only one of these factors in order to prevail. <em>Sweet Grass, </em>¶ 27.

      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>¶17 At the show cause hearing, Dr. Cole contended that St. James breached by changing his staff status from “active” to “consulting” without giving him the three month notice required by Article VII, Part A, Section 3 of the Bylaws. Dr. Cole argued that under Article VIII of the Bylaws, he was entitled to appeal this decision. St. James disagreed, and denied his request for an appeal.

    <p id="b95-8" data-blocks='[["BL_95.9",95,[81,1346,1326,533]]]'>¶19 At the show cause hearing, Dr. Cole also argued that St. James failed to comply with the Bylaws when processing his application for reappointment to the Medical Staff. Specifically, Dr. Cole claimed that St. James violated the Bylaws by appointing Matovich to investigate the allegations of misconduct against him. Instead, Dr. Cole maintained, St. James should have made a written request for an investigation to the President of the Medical Staff, Dr. Popovich. Under Article VIII, Part C of the Bylaws, the President would then appoint an internal investigating committee made up of Dr. Cole’s peers. Dr. Cole contended that St. James breached by failing to follow the procedures set forth in Article VIII, Part C of the Bylaws.</p>

    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[175,1091,1326,334]]]'>¶21 On appeal, St. James argues that the District Court misinterpreted the Bylaws, and asks this Court to decide whether or not it complied with the Bylaws in handling Dr. Cole’s application for re-appointment. This issue goes to the heart of Dr. Cole’s breach of contract claim; again, we do not reach the merits of the ultimate legal questions when reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>Sweet Grass, </em>¶ 38.</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[174,1434,1322,432]]]'>¶22 Under the manifest abuse of discretion standard, we give great deference to a district court’s findings of fact in reviewing the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. <em>Shammel, </em>¶ 12. Based on the evidence produced by Dr. Cole at the show cause hearing, the District Court concluded that Dr. Cole was likely to succeed on the merits of his breach of contract claim. St. James has not challenged these findings, nor have they shown that the issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted an “obvious, evident or unmistakable” abuse of discretion. <em>Shammel, </em>¶ 12.</p>
    <p id="b96-7" data-blocks='[["BL_96.7",96,[173,1876,1323,431]],["BL_97.1",97,[100,317,1325,237]]]'>¶23 Finally, we turn to the District Court’s conclusion that an injunction was an appropriate remedy in the instant case. The District Court concluded that if Dr. Cole were denied the preliminary injunction, and St. James continued its alleged breach, Dr. Cole would suffer irreparable injury. Specifically, the court found that as a result of St. James’s apparent breach, there was a “substantial risk” that St. James would issue an adverse report regarding Dr. Cole to the National Practitioner’s Data Bank (“NPDB”). The District Court analogized an adverse report to “a ‘scarlet letter’ that could <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>permanently harm a physician’s professional reputation.” As a result, the court concluded, “such conduct by the Hospital would render a successful judgment in favor of Dr. Cole ineffectual and meaningless.” Thus, the court held, a money judgment could not adequately address Dr. Cole’s alleged injuries.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[100,563,1325,386]]]'>¶24 In response, St. James argues that no adverse report would be made to NPDB until after Dr. Cole has appealed the Board’s decision denying him reappointment - a process that would take at least several months. As part of the appeals process under Article VIII of the Bylaws, the Board’s decision would undergo peer review by the Medical Staff. Thus, St. James contends, there is little chance that an erroneous adverse report would be made. In sum, St. James asserts, Dr. Cole did not and does not face any imminent injury.</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[97,958,1328,976]]]'>¶25  The purpose of preliminary injunctive relief is to maintain the status quo pending the final outcome of the litigation. We have defined “status quo” as “the last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.” <em>Benefis, </em>¶ 14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, “it is the court’s duty to minimize the injury or damage to all parties to the controversy.” <em>Benefis, </em>¶ 14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Dr. Cole challenged the process by which St. James changed his staff status, investigated allegations of misconduct against him, and denied his application for reappointment. If Dr. Cole is correct, and St. James has breached the Bylaws, the effects of the breach on Dr. Cole’s reputation could be permanent. The District Court restored Dr. Cole to his status as an active staff member, restrained St. James from adopting the recommendation of the challenged Matovich investigation, and from taking any further adverse action on Dr. Cole’s application. The court’s injunction protects both Dr. Cole’s patients and his professional reputation, at a minimal cost to St. James. The preliminary injunction issued by the District Court appropriately minimized injury to both parties in the case, and preserved the status quo pending the final resolution of this litigation.</p>

As discussed above, the requirements of § 27-19-201, MCA, are disjunctive: the moving party must satisfy only one of these factors in order to prevail. <em>Sweet Grass, </em>¶ 27. Since we have concluded that a preliminary injunction was appropriate under § 27-19-201(1), MCA, we need not reach the remaining two subsections discussed by the District Court.</p>

    <p id="b98-8" data-blocks='[["BL_98.9",98,[171,857,1325,678]]]'>¶29 The District Court waded deeply into the merits of this dispute, analyzing the facts and the law. It decided that the Bylaws constituted a contract between the parties (“The Court finds that the elements of a contract are met in this case”). It interpreted the contract (“that procedure [under Article VI, Part C, Section 4(b)] does not constitute peer review. Rather, the procedure for valid ‘peer review investigation’ and ‘peer review recommendation’ is set forth in Article VII”). It then determined that St. James had breached and was continuing to breach the contract (“Based on the record before it, the Court finds the Matovich investigation and resulting recommendation regarding Dr. Cole’s privileges was not peer review.... the Court finds that the Hospital apparently has breached, and continues to breach, the contract between Dr. Cole and the Hospital, as created by the Bylaws.”).</p>

Days ago, we were faced with the same error in <em>City of Whitefish v. Board of County </em>Commissioners, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2008%20MT%20436" class="citation" data-index="21">2008 MT 436</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=347%20Mont.%20490" class="citation" data-index="22">347 Mont. 490</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=199%20P.3d%20201" class="citation" data-index="23">199 P.3d 201</a>, noting that “the [district] court not only anticipated the ultimate determination of the validity of the Agreement, it made the determination outright... This was error.” ¶ 18. We turned back the improperly entered conclusions in <em>City of Whitefish </em>so that they could be determined at trial. I would do the same thing here. After rolling back the improperly entered conclusions, I would consider whether a preliminary injunction should be issued in this case under the correct analysis. <em>City of Whitefish, </em>¶ 19.</p>
    <p id="b99-3" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[91,324,1326,819]]]'>
      <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>¶31 Generally, “[a]n applicant for a preliminary injunction must establish a prima facie case, or show that it is at least doubtful whether or not he will suffer irreparable injury before his rights can be fully litigated.” <em>Benefis, </em>¶ 14. The District Court concluded that Dr. Cole had established a prima facie case, or demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, based upon the improperly entered conclusions, addressed above. Beyond that error, however, I believe the proper, preliminary analysis of the Bylaws necessary to determine whether Dr. Cole had a likelihood of success on the merits demonstrates that the District Court’s approach was significantly flawed. I agree with St. James that the District Court looked to the wrong provisions of the Bylaws in determining what procedures would be required following denial of Dr. Cole’s reappointment application-a critical misstep in assessing the likelihood of success on the merits. Looking at the correct provisions raises a serious question over whether a breach of contract warranting an injunction can be established.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[88,1160,1330,678]]]'>¶32 The Bylaws are laid out as follows: Article VI addresses appointment to the Medical Staff generally, Article VII addresses “Actions Affecting Medical Staff Members,” and Article VIII addresses “Hearing and Appeal Procedures.” Article VII, governing actions affecting medical staff, is further broken into parts that address different situations and the procedures applicable thereto: Part A provides the “Procedure for Reappointment,” Part B provides “Procedures for Requesting Increase in Clinical Privileges,” Part C provides “Procedure for Other Questions Involving Medical Staff Members,” Part D addresses “Summary Suspension of Clinical Privileges,” and Part E addresses “Other Actions.” On the face of these provisions, it appears that Part A should govern this matter, as it specifically addresses, as its title indicates, “Procedures for Reappointment.”</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[86,1847,1326,486]],["BL_100.1",100,[174,320,1323,385]]]'>¶33 Nonetheless, the District Court concluded that the procedures in Part C of Article VII, which generally govern “Other Questions Involving Medical Staff,” control this matter. However, requiring St. James to follow the procedures in Part C for a reappointment application could obviate the reason for Part A’s existence. Under the District Court’s interpretation, the procedures set forth in Part A could be rendered meaningless, potentially subsumed within the more general provisions of Part C. Part C is written broadly and applies “whenever ... [various St. James authorities] has cause to question” a variety of problems with a medical staff member. It appears from a <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>preliminary review that Part C is intended to apply when an authority has cause to question a doctor’s fitness outside of the reappointment application process. The District Court provided no reason why Part C should be applied instead of Part A, at least with regard to the reappointment issue. The specific provisions therein of the procedure to be followed when “the Board determines to reject the favorable recommendations of the Executive Committee” regarding reappointments seem particularly applicable.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[174,710,1323,680]]]'>¶34 The District Court got sidetracked in its extensive discussion about whether the actions undertaken by St. James were properly considered “peer review.” However, the initial question which should have been considered was whether peer review was even required under the applicable Bylaws at this stage, which I seriously question. Article VII, Part A, and Article VI, Part C, appear to grant powers to the Board to discuss an appointment issue with the Executive Committee Chairperson, refer the matter to the Committee for further investigation, and consult with third parties about the applicant. I cannot see that Dr. Cole has established a prima facie case that the Board’s actions in hiring Matovich and proceeding exceed the powers granted it under the Bylaws. See Article VI, Part C, Section 4(b). Then, after the Board makes its decision pursuant to these provisions, Dr. Cole can pursue an appeal, and peer review can come into play.</p>
    <p id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[175,1398,1322,923]],["BL_101.1",101,[92,326,1323,91]]]'>¶35 The Court declines to consider St. James’s likelihood of success arguments. On the one hand, the Court says in ¶ 22 that St. James “has not challenged these findings” of the District Court regarding Dr. Cole’s success on the merits. However, the District Court’s “findings” quoted by the Court in ¶¶ 18 and 20 include conclusions of law about the governing provisions of the Bylaws, which St. James indeed contests. Then, on the other hand, the Court in ¶ 21 dismisses St. James’s arguments because “we do not reach the merits of the ultimate legal questions....” The Court thus reaches its decision without consideration of St. James’s arguments. Somewhere between the conclusion that St. James has not challenged the District Court’s determination on likelihood of success on the merits, and the refusal to consider St. James’s arguments because they go to the merits, St. James’s arguments have completely vanished. Although St. James’s arguments may go too far by touching on ultimate interpretational issues, we should remember that the District Court went even further. St. James argues that the District Court went so far as to harm the Hospital’s case on the merits. I agree with that concern, and I believe we can entertain St. James’s arguments as a proper challenge to the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>District Court’s analysis of the likelihood of success on the merits, and properly consider them for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[90,425,1330,876]]]'>¶36 The Court concludes in ¶ 26 that Dr. Cole established a basis for issuance of an injunction under § 27-19-201(1), MCA. That section addresses likelihood of success on the merits, and for the reasons expressed above, I would disagree. I also agree with St. James’s arguments regarding the likelihood of irreparable harm. St. James has not contested for purposes of this appeal that it erred by the manner in which it reduced Dr. Cole’s privileges from active staff to consulting staff, and has reinstated Dr. Cole’s privileges pending continuation of the process under the Bylaws. This action preserves the status quo, insuring that Dr. Cole will retain his current privileges during an appeal and peer review as provided by the Bylaws. St. James’s position on Dr. Cole’s status and its explanation that no adverse reports about Dr. Cole will be issued until the appeal process and peer review have been completed obviate any need to issue an injunction. The only reason for issuance of the injunction now is to prevent the possibility “that an erroneous adverse report” may be made. Opinion, ¶ 24. However, it is clear that such a remote possibility does not establish a “likelihood” that Dr. Cole will be irreparably harmed.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[89,1308,1325,377]]]'>¶37 The District Court made substantial errors in its analysis. On their face, the Bylaws contain provisions requiring a different procedure for reappointments than recognized by the District Court, which undermine the claim of likelihood of success on the merits. At present, there is little or no likelihood of irreparable harm. I would conclude that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion and reverse those portions of the injunction order challenged on appeal by St. James.</p>
