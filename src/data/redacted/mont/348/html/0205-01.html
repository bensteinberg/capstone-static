These claims alleged that the enactment and enforcement of initiative measure no. 143 (1-143), which was approved by the citizens of Montana on <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>November 7, 2000, constituted a taking of their private property and that they were entitled to just compensation for this taking.

    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[83,562,1325,338]]]'>¶2 The case at bar involves takings claims very similar to claims we recently addressed in <em>Kafka v. Mont. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/mont/348/80/" class="citation" data-index="0" data-case-ids="3727493">2008 MT 460</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/mont/348/80/" class="citation" data-index="1" data-case-ids="3727493">348 Mont. 80</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/mont/348/80/" class="citation" data-index="2" data-case-ids="3727493">201 P.3d 8</a>. Insofar as the background information and our decision and reasoning in <em>Kafka </em>applies to the case at bar, we will refer to that case. Where the arguments and issues raised by the present appellants are distinct from those raised by the parties in <em>Kafka, </em>we will address their merits accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.7",229,[80,909,1332,734]]]'>¶3 The appellants in this case were owners and operators of alternative livestock game farms (Game Farms) within the state of Montana. The Game Farm industry is premised on the notion that individuals are willing to pay significant amounts of money to shoot captive animals, primarily elk, within the confines of a Game Farm. Since 1917, it has been lawful for individuals to own alternative livestock, such as elk, and keep them in captivity. Game Farms are heavily regulated by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) because of the threat posed by chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal disease of the central nervous system of captive and free-ranging animals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, and Rocky Mountain elk. <em>Kafka, </em>¶ 2. To operate a Game Farm, the owner/operator must possess an alternative Game Farm license and comply with the rigorous and extensive licensing requirements set forth in Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶¶ 2, 8.</p>
    <p id="b229-7" data-blocks='[["BL_229.8",229,[79,1652,1326,681]],["BL_230.1",230,[177,315,386,40]]]'>¶4 On November 7,2000, the voters of Montana passed 1-143, which made two significant changes to the regulation of Game Farms in Montana. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶¶ 6-9. First, it prohibited fee-shooting on Game Farms in Montana. Second, 1-143 prohibited licensees from transferring their alternative livestock licenses to others. These changes had a significant impact on the Game Farm industry in Montana because the vitality of the Game Farm industry was premised upon the profits derived from fee-shooting. The ban on the transfer of licenses was significant because it essentially prohibited Game Farm owners from selling those Game Farms to others, since a Game Farm could not operate without a valid license. 1-143 did not, however, eliminate all uses of alternative livestock as it still permitted Game Farm operators to own herds, harvest the animals for their meat or antlers, or sell them in out-of-state markets where fee-shooting was <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>legal. <em>Kafka, </em>¶¶ 7-8.</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[177,362,1327,731]]]'>¶5 The enactment and enforcement of 1-143 led to several lawsuits in both state and federal court in Montana. At the time of this suit, the Buhmanns resided in Blaine County, Montana, and owned and operated the Circle Eagle Game Farm, a twenty-nine acre game farm which was regulated by FWP. The Buhmanns began the Circle Eagle Ranch in 1997 after applying for and receiving a loan from the state of Montana’s Department of Commerce. The Buhmanns’ loan application included a business plan describing an elk-breeding program they planned to institute. This plan included the annual selling of wholesale mature bulls to shooting operations, and the selling of retail mature cows to other breeding operations. The Buhmanns and the Circle Eagle Ranch received an alternative livestock license through FWP which allowed them to keep sixty elk. They began selling elk in 1999. In addition to selling elk, the Buhmanns also sold a mineral supplement for captive deer and elk called Sweet Pro.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[177,1101,1327,576]]]'>¶6 The Wallaces started the Big Velvet Ranch in Ravalli County, Montana, after obtaining a Game Farm license in 1992. The Big Velvet Ranch eventually encompassed roughly 2000 acres. In the course of developing their ranch, the Wallaces purchased material for fencing and other infrastructure, constructed a lodge on the property, removed the native deer and elk, and then imported alternative livestock (elk) from other locations. The Wallaces raised captive elk, and provided opportunities for the fee-shooting of elk on the Big Velvet Ranch. Under this service, clients would come and stay on the Big Velvet Ranch and be guaranteed to shoot an elk within the confines of the ranch. Additionally, the Wallaces bred captive elk for other Game Farms.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[177,1693,1323,632]],["BL_231.1",231,[103,317,1325,91]]]'>¶7 According to the factual assertions in their complaint, the Wallaces invested millions of dollars in developing the Big Velvet Ranch, and took a number of measures to ensure that their alternative livestock was of the highest quality and was disease-free. In 1999, after a three-year testing process, the Big Velvet Ranch was certified as tuberculosis-free, and in 2001 certified as brucellosis-free. Additionally, the Wallaces tested roughly 700 animals from the Big Velvet Ranch for CWD, and all those tests came back negative. The Wallaces also claim they developed prototype feed trucks, and appropriate facility modifications which would allow them to maintain a high nutritional level of the elk, at a cost of over $600,000. The Wallaces further stated that they took other measures, including the hiring of a veterinarian and the development of extensive monitoring systems, to ensure that <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>their operation established a reputation as one of the most successful private elk ranches in the United States.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[102,417,1327,280]]]'>¶8 From 1997 through 1999, the Wallaces claim to have harvested over 100 mature bulls and earned gross revenues of over $1 million per year. The Wallaces allege that their ranch guests would pay on average $7,000 for hunting mature bull elk, and that this comprised the majority of the ranch’s revenues. Between 1995 and 2000, the Wallaces hosted more than 600 clients.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[101,714,1330,1030]]]'>¶9 After the passage of 1-143, and its interpretation by the Attorney General’s office and FWP, the Wallaces claim that their existing and prospective customers cancelled their plans to visit the Big Velvet Ranch, and that many demanded refunds on their deposits. Similarly, there was a cancellation of promised purchases of animals and feed from the Circle Eagle Ranch. The Wallaces claim that in order to stem the financial hemorrhaging at the ranch, they contacted various Indian tribes in Montana to assess their interest in receiving approximately 500 animals from the Big Velvet Ranch. After obtaining the appropriate permits, the Wallaces thereafter entered into an agreement with the Crow Indian Tribe to transfer some of their animals. After the first shipment of 67 elk, the Wallaces were enjoined in the First Judicial District Court from transferring any more of their alternative livestock to the Crow Indian Reservation to be released in an unfenced area. The Wallaces appealed the issuance of this injunction to this Court, and it was upheld in <em>Hagener v. Wallace, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2002%20MT%20109" class="citation" data-index="3">2002 MT 109</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=309%20Mont.%20473" class="citation" data-index="4">309 Mont. 473</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=47%20P.3d%20847" class="citation" data-index="5">47 P.3d 847</a>. The Wallaces also sought injunctions against the enforcement of 1-143 in Ravalli County District Court, as well as separately in the federal district of Montana, both of which were denied. Moreover, Len Wallace was tried and convicted in Justice Court for violating I-143’s ban on fee-shooting.</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[100,1752,1326,583]],["BL_232.1",232,[162,309,1327,631]]]'>¶10 On June 6,2002, the Wallaces and Buhmanns filed a joint action against the state of Montana, Attorney General Mike McGrath, and FWP Director Jeff Hagener in the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Blaine County, seeking damages for the taking of their private property under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution. The Wallaces and Buhmanns alleged that 1-143 violated the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on the taking of private property without just compensation, as well as Article II, Section 29’s prohibition on a damaging of their property. The Wallaces and Buhmanns alleged that 1-143 affected a taking of their private property rights without just compensation “by specifically taking the only viable source of profitability (i.e., shooting animals for a fee), and <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>thereby destroying the Montana breed stock sale market, and prohibiting the transfer of licenses.” The Wallaces and Buhmanns alleged that the State enforced 1-143 to the detriment of their property rights and that this enforcement imposed new retroactive liabilities on them, damaging their vested property rights as well. Additionally, the Wallaces and Buhmanns alleged that by prohibiting the transfer of their licenses and the value of their investments in their Game Farms to others, the State took not only their “property rights and licenses, but also the profitable use of the land, and the increased value of the land as a result of the prior issued licenses.” The Buhmanns and Wallaces also alleged that McGrath and Hagener violated their constitutional rights by enforcing 1-143 against them, and brought a claim for relief under <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="6">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[162,951,1323,386]]]'>¶11 The precise nature of the Buhmanns’ and Wallaces’ claims differed slightly. Because the Buhmanns did not provide fee-shooting services, their business operations were not directly affected by 1-143. However, by eliminating the in-state market for fee-shooting, 1-143 had a significant economic impact on the profitability of their breeder operation and their marketing of Sweet Pro. The Wallaces, on the other hand, were directly affected since the Big Velvet Ranch provided fee-shooting services.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[162,1345,1327,532]]]'>¶12 On July 22,2002, the State filed a motion to change the venue of the case from Blaine County to the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, pursuant to § 25-2-116, MCA. On August 16, 2002, the Wallaces and Buhmanns filed a motion to sever the parties, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 21. In the motion, the Buhmanns argued that their action should remain in Blaine County, while the Wallaces argued that they should be able to pursue their cause of action in Ravalli County under a complaint they filed there on August 6, 2002. On August 28, 2002, the Blaine County District Court denied the motion to sever and granted the State’s motion to change the venue of the case to Lewis and Clark County.</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.6",232,[162,1886,1323,237]],["BL_233.1",233,[85,314,1329,336]]]'>¶13 On September 17, 2002, the First Judicial District Court, Judge Dorothy McCarter presiding, assumed jurisdiction over the appellants’ suit. On October 10,2002, the District Court granted a motion filed by appellees Sportsmen for 1-143 and Montana Wildlife Federation to intervene in this matter. Initially, the District Court set a jury trial to <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>hear appellants’ claims. However, the State subsequently filed a motion to bifurcate the proceedings, arguing that the issue of whether the State was liable for a taking should be decided solely by the District Court. If the State was found liable, then the issue of damages would be submitted to a jury. The appellants resisted the State’s motion, asserting that they were entitled to a jury trial on the issue of takings liability.</p>
    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[83,659,1331,685]]]'>¶14 The State also filed a motion seeking summary judgment on appellants’ takings claims. One aspect of the State’s motion dealt with the issue of whether appellants could assert a categorical takings claim with respect to their personal property (e.g., alternative livestock, and Game Farm equipment). The State argued that under the authority of <em>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=505%20U.S.%201003" class="citation" data-index="7">505 U.S. 1003</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=112%20S.%20Ct.%202886" class="citation" data-index="8">112 S. Ct. 2886</a> (1992), a categorical taking claim may be asserted only for claims regarding a taking of land, and not for a taking of personal property or other property interests. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶¶ 67-69 (noting the distinction between categorical and regulatory takings claims). Since the appellants’ land all retained significant value in spite of the passage of 1-143, a categorical taking claim would fail in this case. Additionally, the State argued that it was further entitled to summary judgment on appellants’ regulatory takings claims.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[83,1353,1331,675]]]'>¶15 After holding a hearing on these motions on October 6, 2004, the District Court granted a portion of the State’s motion, concluding that the question of whether there had been a taking presented a question of law to be determined by the District Court without a jury. If a taking was found by the District Court, it would submit the issue of damages to a jury. Additionally, while the District Court ultimately denied the State’s summary judgment motion and concluded that it would hold a bench trial on appellants’ takings claims, it agreed with the State that under <em>Lucas, </em>personal property could not form the basis for a categorical takings claim. Moreover, the District Court agreed with a legal argument raised in the State’s brief that the same analysis, based on federal law, applied to takings claim, whether brought under Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution or the Fifth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.6",233,[82,2044,1326,280]],["BL_234.1",234,[176,308,1321,132]]]'>¶16 Beginning on November 30,2004, the District Court held a three-day bench trial on appellants’ takings claims. The District Court heard testimony from Bruce Buhmann, Len Wallace, Dr. Peter Nickerson (Dr. Nickerson), an economist and expert witness for appellants, as well as other witnesses for both parties. The District Court also received a number of exhibits into evidence. Based on this evidence <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>and testimony, the District Court made a number of factual findings with respect to the Wallaces’ and Buhmanns’ operations and property interests.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[176,453,1323,971]]]'>¶17 With respect to the Wallaces, the District Court found that they had complied with the licensing requirements set forth by FWP in the operation of the Big Velvet Ranch. The District Court noted that as the Wallaces sought to expand their operation over the years, they had applied with FWP for the necessary expansion permits. In 1997, the Wallaces were denied an expansion request by FWP which would have added approximately 1000 acres to the then-existing roughly 2000 acre ranch. After this denial, the Wallaces decided to sell their property out of a concern that they would not have enough grazing land for their elk. They subsequently acquired a Game Farm in Wisconsin to provide grazing land for their animals, but were prevented from shipping the animals back and forth due to outbreaks of CWD on Game Farms in several states, including Montana. Additionally, the District Court found that prior to 1-143, the Wallaces had difficulty marketing their elk outside of Montana because of a moratorium on interstate elk shipments from Montana as a result of a CWD outbreak on a Montana Game Farm in 1997. The District Court further found that an outbreak of CWD on another Game Farm impacted the ability of the Wallaces to sell their property and that it was still on the market at the time I-143 went into effect.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[175,1441,1324,384]],["BL_235.1",235,[90,306,1325,436]]]'>¶18 The District Court found that after the passage of 1-143, the Wallaces began selling off their elk and Game Farm equipment at a “substantial loss” compared with their pre-I-143 value. Between 1997 and 1999, the Wallaces spent approximately $666,166 to purchase elk. Len Wallace testified that the value of his elk herd prior to 1-143 was roughly $5.5 million. After 1-143, he liquidated the herd for approximately $238,000, and in some cases simply donated his elk to various organizations. Additionally, the Wallaces sold some of their <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>specialized equipment, which cost approximately $600,000to purchase, for $150,000. The District Court found that the net income from the Big Velvet Ranch for the four-year period prior to 1-143 was $1,480,452. Financial records prepared by Dr. Nickerson demonstrated that the Wallaces had a basis of $4,595,123 in their business. Between 1994 and 2003, the records indicated numerous sales of parcels of land ranging between ten and forty acres, totaling more than $1 million dollars, as well as two sales of property to another ranch for more than $5 million dollars.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[90,754,1326,478]]]'>¶19 In total, the District Court concluded that the Wallaces suffered a significant, but not complete, loss of value to their Game Farm business as a result of 1-143. The District Court quantified this loss as a fifty percent reduction in the value of their business. This figure apparently took into account the fact that while the Wallaces’ elk suffered a significant devaluation, the real estate associated with the Big Velvet Ranch had in fact appreciated. The District Court further found that while the market for alternative livestock elk had declined, alternative livestock could still be bred and sold to Game Farms in other states.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[86,1249,1332,878]]]'>¶20 With respect to the Buhmanns, the District Court found that when they initially purchased the land on which the Circle Eagle Game Farm is located in the mid-1980’s, they had no intention of operating a Game Farm but chose that course much later. The District Court found that the Buhmanns purchased all of their elk in 1997 for $29,500, and began selling them in 1999. Their total sales receipts through 2000 were $8,948, and they received $11,963 from elk sales in 2001 and 2002. They anticipated selling approximately 10 calves a year for about $30,000. With respect to their sales of Sweet Pro, the District Court found they had gross sales for this product of approximately $68,000 between 2000 and 2002. For the overall period of their business from 1997 to 2002, they had a net business loss of $41,325. With respect to the impact on their business from 1-143, the District Court found that no aspect of that business was prohibited because they did not operate a fee-shooting operation. However, 1-143 did affect the market for both their alternative livestock and Sweet Pro. The District Court concluded that the Buhmanns suffered a net loss of $22,000 as a result of 1-143.</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[86,2137,1326,187]],["BL_236.1",236,[164,306,1323,382]]]'>¶21 In its conclusions of law, the District Court began by restating its determination that the same legal analysis, based upon federal law, applied to claims whether brought under the Fifth Amendment or Article II, Section 29. Moreover, the District Court stated that a <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>categorical takings claim did not lie in this case under <em>Lucas </em>because categorical takings apply only to takings of land.

    <p id="AXy" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[103,1156,1328,635]]]'>¶31 Although the Wallaces’ and Buhmanns’ complaint asserted only two counts, the District Court determined that they asserted more than two claims for purposes of the statute because the specific allegations and relief sought by the Buhmanns was sufficiently distinct from the specific allegations and relief sought by the Wallaces. The District Court observed that it is the nature of the rights asserted and demand for relief sought that determines the number of claims, rather than a formal designation in the complaint itself. The District Court noted that the Wallaces and Buhmanns each detailed different locations and businesses which were differently affected by 1-143, and that the damages in each case differed based not only on these different locations but also on the duration of the effect, the type of the business, and the extent of the respective parties’ investments.</p>

Thus, under § 25-2-126(1), MCA, Lewis and Clark County would be the only appropriate venue for all parties. Since the State was entitled to a change of venue under § 25-2-116, MCA, by virtue of the presence of multiple claims, the Blaine County District Court concluded that a change of venue to Lewis and Clark County was appropriate.</p>

On the one hand, the District Court concluded that the Buhmanns had failed to show good cause under M. R. Civ. P. 42(b), to separate the claims, and further failed to demonstrate how their access to court in Lewis and Clark County would be impractical or expensive. With respect to the Wallaces’ motion to sever, the District Court denied that motion under the authority of <em>Emery v.

With respect to the motion to sever, the State points out that the decision of whether to sever claims lies within the District Court’s discretion under § 25-2-116, MCA, and M. R. Civ.

Del Monte Dunes consequently filed a suit in federal district court alleging, among other things, that the denial amounted to an uncompensated taking under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Del Monte Dunes, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=526%20U.S.%20687" class="citation" data-index="48">526 U.S. at 698</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=119%20S.%20Ct.%201624" class="citation" data-index="49">119 S.

Neither the 1889 or 1972 Montana Constitutions evince any intent that it apply to regulatory takings or damages resulting therefrom. Moreover, the provision mandates that private property not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation “having been first made to or paid into court for the owner.” This language obviously contemplates a condemnation of property by the State, and the recognition that the appropriation will cause determinable consequential damages to property owners affected thereby-damages which can be ascertained at the time of the taking. Simply put, the plain language of Article II, Section 29 does not suggest that the provision was intended to apply to the types of damages a regulatory <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>taking might arguably cause over time, after a regulation has taken its toll on a property owner. And, notably, neither the appellants nor the Dissent have cited a single case for the proposition that the “or damaging” language-which, incidentally, is present in roughly half of the state constitutions in this country, <em>see Kafka, </em>¶ 30, n. 5-is intended to provide any greater protections in the regulatory taking context than does the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or that it applies to anything other than the consequential damages to the property of persons affected by a physical condemnation, or similar actions, initiated by the State.</p>

First, <em>Manufactured Housing </em>did not discuss the meaning of the “or damaged” language in the Washington State Constitution in the context of a regulatory takings claims. Thus, the significance of the Dissent’s citation to this case in the present context is unclear. Second, the Washington takings test has four distinct inquiries, which are grounded partly in federal and partly in state law. <em>Manufactured Housing, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=13%20P.3d%20183" class="citation" data-index="110">13 P.3d at 187</a>. The Dissent, however, does not propose a distinct new test, or indeed, any analogous test. Rather, the Dissent simply argues that the federal tests should not apply, and that, instead, whenever there is any damage to private property by state action, compensation is required-whether the action was actually a taking or not. This amounts to a radically scaled-back <em>Penn Central </em>analysis: There need be no inquiry into the character of the government action or the reasonable investment-backed expectations of the claimant; rather, the only inquiry is whether there was any economic impact. Since the Dissent does not provide any guidance or bright line as to how much economic impact is enough to trigger a damaging-relying more on a “I know it when I see it” reflex <em>(see </em>Dissent, ¶ 167) — it is difficult to envision how the State could confidently afford to regulate anything <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>under such a regime.

Under the economic impact factor of this analysis, <em>see Kafka, </em>¶ 72, the District Court made the following findings: (1) 1-143 prohibited the Wallaces’ fee-shooting business entirely, and eliminated the in-state market for the Buhmanns but did not prohibit the sales of their elk and Sweet Pro feed supplements to out-of-state buyers; (2) neither the Wallaces nor Buhmanns lost any significant value in their land or improvements; (3) both the Wallaces and Buhmanns lost substantial value in their elk herds; (4) both parties lost future expected profits; (5) both businesses had already been negatively affected by prior outbreaks of CWD, and that CWD was in fact one of the reasons why appellants could not profitably dispose of their alternative livestock to out-of-state markets; and (6) the Wallaces had already made a decision to get out of the Game Farm business prior to the passage of 1-143. Based on these <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>findings, the District Court concluded that the economic impact factor of the <em>Penn Central </em>regulatory takings analysis test favored the appellants.</p>

However, the District Court noted that under <em>Penn Central, </em>this investment-backed expectation is measured from an objective standpoint in terms of its reasonableness. The District Court, citing to <em>Mitchell Arms, Inc. v. United States, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=7%20F.3d%20212" class="citation" data-index="136">7 F.3d 212</a> (Fed.

In this regard, the District Court distinguished a case relied upon by appellants, <em>Yancey v.

With respect to the economic impact factor, appellants agree with the conclusion that this amounted to a significant impact. However, appellants assert that the District <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>Court understated this impact because it evaluated the business as a whole, including the real estate (which had appreciated in spite of I-143), when appellants argue they did not claim a taking of their real property, but only of the business itself. They assert that a finding that 1-143 led to a fifty-percent reduction in their business is misleading because it includes in the computation the value of appreciated real estate. Instead, the Wallaces argue the impact should be measured in terms of the market value of the alternative livestock before 1-143 ($5.5 million dollars), versus its market value afterwards ($238,000). Similarly, the Wallaces argue that the true economic impact on their business by 1-143 was that it destroyed it. The Buhmanns maintain I-143 had a similar impact on their business as well.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[84,921,1328,1067]]]'>¶87 With respect to the character of the governmental action factor, appellants argue that this factor also weighs in favor of a compensable taking because 1-143 does not address the problems associated with Game F arms (i. e., threat from C WD, or threatening the heritage of fair chase hunting) since it still permits the existence of Game Farms. In actuality, appellants argue, 1-143 is nothing more than a price control measure designed to protect the State’s competing enterprise of selling licenses for the shooting of wild, non-captive game. Finally, under the investment-backed expectations factor, appellants maintain that the District Court erred in relying upon <em>Mitchell Arms andAllied-General, </em>and that an analysis under <em>Yancey </em>supports their position. Appellants argue that they are not complaining that a particular regulation has made Game Farms more expensive, but that 1-143 directly prohibited the sale of a product in a manner contrary to their reasonable investment-backed expectations, because the State has never exercised any regulation over the fees charged for privately shooting alternative livestock. While the participants in the Game Farm industry might have reasonably expected that they would have to maintain extra fencing or increase testing of their livestock, they had no reason to anticipate state interference in the price they would be able to charge for fee-shooting. Thus, they argue, this factor should weigh in their favor.</p>

As an initial matter, we note that because the appellants in this case, like those in <em>Kafka, </em>allege that a mix of property interests have been taken by 1-143, and do not allege that I-<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>143 took all of their property interests (i.e., appellants do not claim that 1-143 impacts the real property comprising their Game Farms at all) we will consider each of those business interests separately for purpose of a regulatory takings analysis. <em>Kafka, </em>¶ 37.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[181,520,1323,387]]]'>¶89 Regarding the regulatory taking of intangible assets, i.e., appellants’ businesses in this case, we held in <em>Kafka </em>that businesses themselves cannot be taken unless the government physically condemns those businesses and runs them itself. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶¶ 55-63. In <em>Kafka </em>we analyzed both the <em>Mitchell Arms </em>and <em>Allied-General </em>decisions in reaching this conclusion. Therefore, for the reasons set forth in <em>Kafka, </em>we hold that appellants’ businesses in this case were not taken by 1-143.</p>
    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[182,916,1321,779]]]'>¶90 Accordingly, this leaves appellants’ elk and related Game Farm equipment. Under the economic impact prong of <em>Penn Central, </em>we agree with the District Court that 1-143 had a significant impact on the value of the Wallaces’ and Buhmanns’ alternative livestock. For purposes of this factor, the District Court found that the Wallaces had invested approximately $666,166 in elk purchases from 1997 through 1999. Before 1-143 the market value of the alternative livestock (approximately 850 head of elk) was roughly $5.5 million; after 1-143, the Wallaces liquidated the herd for $238,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The Wallaces’ Game Farm equipment (the specialized feeding trucks) were purchased for roughly $600,000 and sold for $150,000. The Buhmanns similarly had invested in the alternative livestock, and although the ban on fee-shooting did not directly prohibit them from breeding alternative livestock, it did cause a similar devaluation in their herd and also impacted their ability to sell Sweet Pro in Montana. Accordingly, the economic impact factor weighs in appellants’ favor.</p>

As we noted in <em>Kafka, </em>while 1-143 impaired the profitable use of alternative livestock, it still allowed appellants every other use of their alternative livestock; thus, from the perspective of <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>regulatory takings law, the character of the governmental action embodied in 1-143 had a minimally intrusive effect on appellants’ bundle of property interests in the alternative livestock. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶¶ 87-88. The same would be true with respect to the Wallaces’ specialized Game Farm equipment, as it could still be sold to out-of-state markets. Thus, while we disagree with the analysis employed by the District Court under this factor because it inquired into the purposes and propriety of 1-143 in a manner foreclosed by <em>Lingle, (see </em>Opinion, ¶ 80), we nonetheless agree with the District Court’s conclusion that this factor weighs against finding a compensable taking. <em>See Wells Fargo Bank v.

In this connection, we agree with the District Court that <em>Yancey </em>does not alter the regulatory takings analysis in this case. In <em>Yancey, </em>Andrew and Elizabeth Yancey (Yanceys) owned and operated a turkey breeding operation in Rockingham County, Virginia. <em>Yancey, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=915%20F.2d%201534" class="citation" data-index="142">915 F.2d at 1536</a>. In 1983, the Yanceys acquired a rafter of turkey breeder hens for purposes of selling the hatching eggs to customers in other states. In mid-October 1983, an outbreak of a pathogenic Avian Influenza occurred in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, prompting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to impose a quarantine in that state, which was later extended to Rockingham County, Virginia as well. The quarantine prohibited the Yanceys from the interstate shipping of live poultry, manure from the poultry, litter used by the poultry, as well as carcasses, eggs and certain equipment. Although the Yanceys’ flock was not affected by the influenza, they were unable to make productive use of the flock as they intended, and had to maintain the flock at a cost of $1,800 per week. They ultimately decided to slaughter the flock and sell it for meat, although the flock had not been raised to be economically viable for that purpose. They received $20,887 for the flock.</p>

The claim was denied and they filed a takings claim in the U.S. Claims Court under the Fifth Amendment. The claims court granted the Yanceys’ Fifth Amendment claim, and the government appealed. On appeal, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals had to determine whether the effects of the quarantine constituted a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Yancey, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=915%20F.2d%201534" class="citation" data-index="143">915 F.2d at 1539</a>.</p>

Moreover, the court of appeals noted the lower court finding that the Yanceys only learned about the quarantine through the newspaper the day before it took effect and that they had investment-backed expectations to sell the hatching eggs to customers outside of Virginia-an action that was foreclosed by the immediate, unforeseen and disparate impact upon the Yanceys by the quarantine. <em>Yancey, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=915%20F.2d%201534" class="citation" data-index="145">915 F.2d at 1540</a>.</p>

The District Court specifically found that a previous outbreak of CWD on a Montana Game Farm in 1997 had already impeded the Wallaces’ sale of alternative livestock to out-of-state markets after the imposition of a moratorium on out-of-state sales, and that their ability to sell the Big Velvet Ranch before the passage of 1-143 was negatively impacted from the previous CWD outbreaks.

Moreover, there was no live test for CWD which is a permanent and irreversible disease. <em>Hagener, </em>¶ 25.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Moreover, the District Court explicitly found that the exact incubation period and <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>means of transmitting CWD are not completely understood. In fact, it was primarily the grave threat posed by CWD which required the extensive regulation of the Game Farm industry in Montana. <em>See Kafka, </em>¶ 8. It was against the backdrop of these inherent dangers that appellants were operating. Moreover, these dangers were publicly known and very controversial among many members of the public. Thus, unlike <em>Yancey, </em>where the poultry producers would have no reason to expect that a healthy flock of turkeys would have to be suddenly destroyed, those in the Game Farm industry knew that their alternative livestock carried with them an inherent danger of spreading CWD which could never be eliminated and which could prove uncontrollable if it made its way into the genetic make-up of the native wildlife populations. These facts, together with the highly regulated nature of the industry, must be considered when evaluating the “reasonableness” of appellants’ investment-backed expectations.</p>

The State encouraged people to embark on this “viable economic opportunity,” facilitated their investment of millions of dollars into such enterprises, and granted them a statutory right to perpetual renewal of their business licenses. Then, the State up and legislated the businesses out of existence. According to the Court, such action does not constitute a taking or damaging of property under Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution.</p>

This pronouncement finds no support in the text of Article II, Section 29, which is facially broader than the Fifth Amendment. It finds no support in the history of Article II, Section 29 and its predecessor, Article III, Section 14 of the 1889 Constitution, which were intended to provide greater protection than the Fifth Amendment against infringements on Montanans’ property rights. It finds no support in the prior decisions of this Court, which recognize independent protections of property under the Montana Constitution.

Adopting an originalist interpretation of Article II, Section 29, the Court rejects the notion that the terms “taking” and “damaging” together were meant to provide a broader range of protection than <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>extant Fifth Amendment jurisprudence provides.

The Sportsmen, who were “the principle forces behind the passage of 1-143,” sought to snuff out alternative livestock ranching without the public’s having to foot the bill. To that end, they “carefully crafted” a citizen initiative (1-143) to prohibit remuneration for shooting alternative livestock on alternative livestock ranches, thereby forcing all businesses in the industry to operate, essentially, without any income. <em>See Kafka Dissent, </em>¶¶ 114-120.

Rather, according to the Sportsmen, “[f]oremost among the issues presented to the voters in 1-143 were concerns about disease, loss of fair chase hunting ethics and European style privatization of wildlife.” In other words, the Sportsmen told the voters not that 1-143 had been “carefully crafted” to obliterate an entire industry-an industry that had been sanctioned, encouraged, and nurtured by the State for 83 years, no less-but that 1-143 was “aimed” at the alluring goal of “protecting Montana’s wildlife and hunting heritage from a variety of dangers posed by game farms.” An analysis of the Initiative, however, reveals that it did not actually address any of these dangers. As a matter of fact, the Sportsmen tacitly admit that 1-143 was a fraud on Montana voters.</p>

They state that “[cjontact between game farm animals and wildlife can result in disease and parasite transmission, with devastating impacts to native wildlife.” They complain that “[g]ame farm enclosures require only a single fence and do not prevent nose to nose contact between wild ungulates and game farm animals.” Plus, “[i]t is virtually impossible to keep game farm animals from coming into contact with wild animals, as escaped animals are a fact of life for game farm owners.” Moreover, aside from direct contact, “[s]ome diseases are transmitted by intermediate hosts, making any form of <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>enclosure ineffective for disease prevention.”</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[176,366,1328,930]]]'>¶111 The Sportsmen argued these concerns to the voters. Indeed, the Sportsmen cite the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet for the proposition that “[o]ne of I-143’s primary purposes was to minimize the CWD threat to Montana’s wildlife.” (“CWD” is short for “chronic wasting disease.”) Accordingly, given these concerns, one would expect 1-143 to target the problems related to diseases, perhaps through more stringent fencing and enclosure requirements, additional testing requirements, or even an outright seizure of all alternative livestock along with a prohibition on private ownership of alternative livestock. However, 1-143 did none of these things. As the Sportsmen acknowledge, “[g]ame farms licensed prior to November 2000, are still legal in Montana, even after 1-143,” and “[g]ame farm operators are free to ‘acquire, breed, grow, pursue, handle, sell or dispose’ of game farm animals.” 1-143 imposed no new fencing or testing requirements. It does not prohibit people from owning alternative livestock on alternative livestock ranches, and it does not address the problem of transmission of diseases through intermediate hosts or inadequate fencing. In spite of the dire threat posed by diseases, the Sportsmen’s initiative contains nothing addressing that issue.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[177,1305,1327,680]]]'>¶112 As for hunting ethics, the Sportsmen state that “Montana has a proud heritage of ethical hunting and the protection of wildlife, and 1-143 was intended to protect the state’s interest in those traditions.” They assert that “[i]n addition to the enormous economic benefits of traditional big game hunting, Montanans hold dear their hunting tradition as an important component of their western heritage,” particularly “the concept of fair chase hunting.” The Sportsmen explain that they and other citizens “opposed the ‘penned hunts’ offered by many game farms” because “[s]hooting an animal in an enclosed facility is repugnant to these ethical hunting traditions.” Again, citing the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet, the Sportsmen state that “[t]he protection of fair chase hunting, as an ethical consideration for Montanans, was an integral part of I-143’s provisions to eliminate penned shoots.”</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[178,1993,1323,337]]]'>¶113 1-143, however, contains no “provisions to eliminate penned shoots.” 1-143 did three things: it prohibited the establishment of any new alternative livestock ranches; it revoked the right of existing alternative livestock businesses to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses; and it prohibited charging a fee or other remuneration for shooting alternative livestock on an alternative livestock facility. <em>See generally </em>Laws of Montana 2001,2000 Ballot Issues, Initiative No.</p>

Indeed, the Sportsmen concede that “[g]ame farm operators are not prohibited by 1-143 from shooting or otherwise ‘harvesting5 their animals themselves.” For that matter, 1-143 does not prohibit the friends, relatives, and acquaintances of an alternative livestock operator from shooting alternative livestock on an alternative livestock ranch. “The only activity on licensed game farms prohibited under 1-143,” the Sportsmen state, “is that of allowing a fee-paying individual the opportunity to personally shoot a game farm animal.” But anyone who is not a “fee-paying individual55 may still participate in penned hunts and “personally shoot a game farm animal” notwithstanding 1-143. So much for protecting Montana’s “proud heritage” of ethical, fair-chase hunting.</p>

Yet, as the Sportsmen are forced to concede, “1-143 allow[s] the continued ownership of game farms and elk,” and alternative livestock ranchers “are free to ‘acquire, breed, grow, pursue, handle, sell or dispose’ of game farm animals” in Montana. Moreover, 1-143 does not provide for less expensive hunting licenses or greater access to big game on public and private lands.</p>

Rather, it was “carefully crafted” to achieve the Sportsmen’s ulterior goal of putting all alternative livestock ranches out of business. The Proponents’ argument in favor of the Initiative was blatantly misleading in assuring voters that “[e]xisting game farms will be allowed to continue all operations, except for canned hunts.” 1-143 was designed to shut down <em>all </em>alternative livestock ranches by forcing them to operate with no income.</p>
    <p id="b267-7" data-blocks='[["BL_267.6",267,[86,2103,1325,237]],["BL_268.1",268,[170,314,1327,636]]]'>¶116 The Sportsmen claim that 1-143 merely “added to the existing restrictions” on the operation of alternative livestock ranches. They also assert that the Ranchers have not established that the “additional restrictions” are “so onerous that the effect is the same as ‘an appropriation of property through eminent domain or physical <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>appropriation.’ ” This is hypocrisy personified. 1-143 did not “add” to “existing restrictions.” It devised a whole new restriction previously unheard of in the industry: no remuneration for shooting alternative livestock. The Sportsmen’s contrary characterization of 1-143 is absurd. It is one thing to strengthen fencing, testing, and reporting requirements through “additional restrictions,” as the Legislature did over the years. But it is quite another to require alternative livestock ranchers to operate with no income through the expedient of prohibiting remuneration for the key economic activity on which their businesses depended: fee shooting. The Sportsmen “carefully crafted” 1-143 to destroy the Ranchers’ businesses, and they succeeded in doing so. It is difficult to conceive of a regulation that more closely approximates “an appropriation of property.”</p>

As late as 1999, the State characterized alternative livestock ranching as “a viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.” Section 87-4-431, MCA. Moreover, as the State reluctantly conceded at oral argument in <em>Kafka, </em>“There is some evidence to suggest that it was the policy of the political branches of government to encourage people to look at game farming as an alternative to traditional agriculture-actually, to subsidize traditional agriculture so they could stay on the farms and ranches.” The Sportsmen, however, objected to alternative livestock ranching. They decided to shut down the industry. They did so for the stated purpose of “protecting Montana’s wildlife and hunting heritage.” They argued to the voters that 1-143 was intended to benefit the entire Montana populace. Yet, the Sportsmen sought to place all of the economic costs associated with achieving this goal on the alternative livestock ranchers. They sought, in other words, to give the public something for nothing.</p>

There is no reason to construe the term “property” in Article II, Section 29 differently. Nothing in the text or history of this provision and its predecessor (Article III, Section 14 of the 1889 Constitution) suggests that the meaning of “property” and the rights associated with ownership are limited to the conceptions existing in 1889 or 1972.

Second, the Court’s assertion could also be made about the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, which simply states: “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” There is no more reason to conclude that this language encompasses regulatory takings than there is to conclude that the pertinent language of Article II, Section 29 (“Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.”) encompasses regulatory takings. Yet, the former does encompass regulatory takings, <em>see Penn Central Transp. Co. v.

Opinion, ¶ 69. I disagree for the simple reason that the Court’s interpretation is inconsistent with the “or damaged” clause and leads to an absurd result. The clause relied on by the Court (“having been first made to or paid into court for the owner”) requires the State to pay just compensation “to the full extent of the loss” in advance. Certainly, this may be done when the State sets out to “take” property. But it is pure folly to suggest that the State may do the same with respect to “damaging” property. How could it possibly be known, in advance, all of the properties that will be damaged during the course of a public works project and what “the full extent of the loss” will be? “Obviously,” it cannot be known. The Court creates an absurd result by applying the advance-payment clause to the damaging clause. <em>Cf.

Article II, Section 29 does not in any way describe, define, or circumscribe the ways in which private property may be “taken or damaged.” It simply states, “Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use ....” Clearly, property is “taken” for public use in an eminent domain proceeding.

Yet, that too is water over the dam. Rather, the point to be made in this case and in <em>Kafka </em>is that if the voters want to vote an “offensive” industry out of existence, so be it. But they need to understand (as they did not here) that there is cost to doing so, and Article II, Section 29 guarantees payment regardless of whether the business owners are perceived as bad people.

This Court has now cabined the scope of Article II, Section 29 beyond its historical underpinnings and its plain language.

Because of the majority’s circuitous reasoning, its disdain for private property rights, its endorsement of unprincipled and unfettered government action, which will result in the total loss of value, without compensation, of some of the property at issue, and its disavowal of the plain language of the Montana Constitution, I offer additional comments. Justice Nelson exhaustively discussed the applicable law, and I will not repeat that here. I would find that a taking occurred under both the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution in this case and in <em>Kafka v.

Article II, Section 29 says, “Private property shall not be taken or damaged for <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>public use without just compensation ....” It does not say “real property” or “land.” It does not exclude businesses and all their accoutrements. It does not say that a physical invasion has to occur for damage or a taking to occur. The 1972 Constitutional Convention left the language from the 1889 Constitution intact, foreclosing the possibility of a lockstep march with the federal government. The majority can offer no textual basis in the Montana Constitution for providing less protection to personal, business, and intangible property than for real property. Private property is private property.</p>
    <p id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[91,764,1328,585]]]'>¶182 The majority does claim that it is just too hard to determine damages in certain types of property. Apparently, trial judges will no longer be burdened with giving the instruction that simply because damages are hard to determine does not mean that none exist and should not be awarded. The majority also apparently believes that juries are not capable of weighing factual issues in takings cases. Thomas Jefferson said, “I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> His statement was prescient. In this case, the majority has denied appellants the opportunity to prove their damages to a jury and has sanctioned a governmental violation of constitutional principles.</p>
    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[92,1357,1330,486]]]'>¶183 There is no justification under the Montana Constitution for a different set of rules for regulatory takings versus an actual occupation of property. The State, when it takes property of any kind, should pay; the more it takes the more it should pay. The takings provision in the Montana Constitution prevents abuse by the State of its eminent domain power and provides protection for private property rights. Freedom and prosperity suffer without such protections. Unfortunately for all citizens of Montana, this Court has ignored its obligations and has abandoned any effort to match the benefits to the State of this taking with the burden imposed on the businesses.</p>
    <p id="b293-6" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[91,1850,1325,336]],["BL_294.1",294,[179,310,1322,390]]]'>¶184 For that matter, it is legitimate to ask what benefit was received. The State, in its argument, asserted that this was a legitimate exercise of the State’s “police power,” a term often used in constitutional discourse but a term that does not appear in the constitution. As written and passed, 1-143 did not benefit the State. The State claims that some people in Montana were offended by fee hunting. Yet, it is remarkable that their only concern was the <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>exchange of money, not the killing. In reviewing the Montana Constitution, I did not find a constitutional right not to be offended. It must be there because it is the only hook the majority can hang their hat on as suggesting a benefit. 1-143 did not ban the existence of elk farms; it did not ban the shooting of elk within an elk farm; it did not change the amount of regulation; it did nothing to control disease or lessen contact between captive and wild animals; and it did nothing to preserve the State’s hunting heritage.</p>
    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[180,705,1321,576]]]'>¶185 What 1-143 did was prohibit fee hunting. It completely destroyed the value of the businesses, which includes the license and other intangible assets, and about 90% of the value of the livestock. This is after, as aptly described by Justice Nelson, the State facilitated and encouraged elk farms and the spending of hundreds of thousands of dollars in specialized capital expenditures. Considering that game farms had been sanctioned in this state for over 80 years, to claim now that these appellants had no reasonable expectation they would be allowed to operate their businesses for profit is offensive to any modicum of common sense. Apparently, the power to regulate, in the majority’s view, equals the power to destroy. I do not believe this is what the constitutional conventioneers had in mind.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[179,1296,1326,778]]]'>¶ 186 It is disturbing that this Court did not attempt to balance costs and benefits. The appellants in this case and in <em>Kafka </em>lost millions of dollars so some people were no longer offended. The rule from this Court: The State wins and pays nothing as long as there is a hint of benefit to the State, even if the private property owner suffers pounds of burden. Justice Holmes was worried about the use of the police power as justification when he stated: “The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment... provides that it shall not be taken ... without compensation.... When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears.” <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=260%20U.S.%20393" class="citation" data-index="334">260 U.S. 393</a>, 415, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=43%20S.%20Ct.%20158" class="citation" data-index="335">43 S. Ct. 158</a>, 160 (1922). Today’s majority opinion is the type of decision he was concerned about and leads to the inescapable conclusion that, in Montana, actual benefit does not have to occur before fundamental rights are destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[180,2084,1321,231]]]'>¶187 The Sportsmen’s and the majority’s assertions that 1-143 served “weighty” and “vital” purposes is laughable. 1-143 did not directly address any of the concerns that led to its passage. It was deceptive and a charade by design-deception and fraud embraced by this Court.</p>

Without property rights, no other rights are possible. These principles are embodied in the Montana Constitution in Article II, Sections 3 and 29. I invite the majority to read them. The fundamental rights to acquire, possess, and protect property are not even given lip service by this Court. Under the majority’s opinion, the State suffers no consequences for the exercise of coercive and unreasonable power in destroying these businesses. There is no serious effort to balance benefits and burdens. It may be too early to start asking, “Who is John Galt?”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> but more decisions like this will seriously impact all private property and business owners in this State.</p>
