We affirm.</p>
    <p id="b105-8" data-blocks='[["BL_105.10",105,[242,1164,1007,34]]]'>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b105-9" data-blocks='[["BL_105.11",105,[82,1213,1329,431]]]'>¶2 Appellants in this case are all owners and operators of alternative livestock game farms (Game Farms) within the state of Montana. To operate a Game Farm, the owner/operator must have a valid alternative Game Farm license (License) issued by FWP. The requirements for the Licenses are found in Title 87, chapter 4, part 4 of the Montana Code Annotated and are fairly demanding due to the threat posed by chronic wasting disease (CWD).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The appellants in this case all obtained their Licenses at varying times throughout the 1990’s and have complied with the requirements of part 4 since that time.</p>
    <p id="b105-10" data-blocks='[["BL_105.12",105,[79,1650,1327,485]],["BL_106.1",106,[177,319,1323,383]]]'>¶3 Kim and Cindy Kafka (Kafkas) are members of Diamond K Ranch Enterprises, LLC, located in Hill County. In 1996, the Kafkas applied for a License with FWP and entered into a lease for a tract of land on which to operate an alternative livestock breeding operation. After receiving their License, they began operating in March 1997. In 1998, after obtaining a second License, the Kafkas expanded their operations to focus on the fee-shooting of alternative livestock as their primary revenue source. This operation was conducted on an 1100-acre parcel of land roughly twenty miles from the site of the original breeding operation. The Kafkas purchased this land through a series of three <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>transactions, beginning in 1993 and ending with the finalization of a deed in 2003. In addition to purchasing land and going through the License application process, the Kafkas invested several hundred thousand dollars in other start-up costs, including fencing and the acquisition of stock. According to the record, these costs totaled roughly $463,000. In 1999, the Kafkas reported $11,000 in income from their Game Farm operations on their federal tax returns, with that figure rising significantly during the year 2000.</p>
    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[177,710,1323,723]]]'>¶4 Jim and Barbara Bouma (Boumas) operate a Game Farm in Teton County. The Boumas began their Game Farm operations in May 1997, by operating a breeder facility which would allow them to market large shooter bulls to other Game Farms which allowed fee-shooting. Like the Kafkas, the Boumas hold Licenses issued by FWP. The Boumas’ breeder operation spans three parcels of land, two of which they acquired in 1996 at a price of $55,000 and a third totaling 126.777 acres, which was acquired as part of a larger purchase of 258.067 acres in December 1999 for approximately $325,000. In March 2000, the Boumas sought to expand their operations onto the remaining 129 acres of their parcel. Like the Kafkas, the Boumas made other investments necessary to institute their breeder operation, such as acquiring stock, License-related application costs, and fencing. According to the record, the Boumas never sold significant numbers of alternative livestock and their operation never generated a taxable profit.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[177,1441,1323,569]]]'>¶5 Jack and Myra Bridgewater (Bridgewaters) are the owners of the Phantom Bull Elk Ranch, LLC, located in Broadwater County. The Bridgewaters entered into the Game Farm business in 1992, and focused primarily on fee-shooting as the primary source of income, although they had also harvested and marketed antlers from their alternative livestock for the velvet market. They purchased the property on which their Game Farm operated in 1990 for approximately $415,000. Like the other appellants, the Bridgewaters invested in the infrastructure necessary to operate a Game Farm. Between 1993 and 2000, their Game Farm generated cash flow in excess of $1.1 million dollars, although the Bridgewaters never reported any profit on their tax returns.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[178,2026,1322,284]],["BL_107.1",107,[83,322,1325,330]]]'>¶6 As is common among regulatory schemes, the requirements for maintaining a License under part 4 have changed somewhat throughout the years. However, on November 7,2000, part 4 underwent a radical change as a result of the passage of Initiative Measure No. 143 (1-143) by the citizens of Montana. 1-143 amended two very significant subsections of part 4. First, it resulted in the deletion of the existing <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>language in § 87-4-412(2), MCA (1999),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which permitted a License holder to transfer his License, and substituted the following: “An alternative livestock ranch license for a specific facility is not transferable.” Section 87-4-412(2), MCA (2001). More significant was I-143’s effect on § 87-4-414(2), MCA (1999), as indicated below. The pre-I-143 version of the statute is in normal type face, and the 1-143 addition to the statute is in bold.</p>
    <p id="b107-3" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[174,669,1234,388]]]'>(2) The licensee may acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year as long as the licensee complies with the requirements of this part, except that the licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock, as defined in 87-2-101 or 87-4-406, or of any exotic hig game species for a fee or other remuneration on an alternative livestock facility.</p>
    <p id="b107-4" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[85,1066,967,40]]]'>Section 87-4-414(2), MCA (2001) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[81,1114,1326,627]]]'>¶7 Notably, the initiative did not revoke appellants’ Licenses, nor did it result in the confiscation of their alternative livestock. Instead, 1-143 prohibited Game Farm operators from charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock. This was a significant departure from the previous scheme because some individuals were willing to expend significant amounts of money to shoot alternative livestock within the confines of a Game Farm. By prohibiting fee-shooting, 1-143 eliminated the most profitable use of the alternative livestock, and thus the profitability of Game Farms in Montana. At the same time, it did not eliminate all uses of the alternative livestock, as part 4 still permitted Game Farm owners to maintain their herds, harvest the animals for their meat or antlers, or sell them in out-of-state markets where fee-shooting was still legal.</p>
    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.7",107,[80,1750,1326,382]],["BL_108.1",108,[175,322,1327,722]]]'>¶8 Aside from these small but extremely significant changes, the remainder of part 4 was unaltered by I-143’s passage. All parties concede that the Game Farm industry was, and still is, a highly regulated industry. Both before and after the passage of 1-143, part 4 conditioned the ability of the licensee to breed, harvest, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock upon “compli[ance] with the requirement of this part ....” Section 87-4-414(2), MCA. Part 4 also states that FWP reserves the right to revoke a License if the owner/operator “fail[s] to <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>operate an alternative livestock ranch according to the provisions of this part, rules adopted under this part, or stipulations of the alternative livestock ranch license....” Section 87-4-427(l)(a), MCA. Part 4 outlines in detail the reporting, testing, and recording duties incumbent upon a Game Farm operator, details the steps the operator must take to receive a License, and gives FWP broad authority to inspect and quarantine alternative livestock if necessary. Part 4 also requires environmental assessments (EA) of any proposed operations. It places conditions upon the use and disposition of alternative livestock, and further provides that alternative livestock are the private property of the License holder “for which the licensee is responsible as provided by law.” Section 87-4-414(1), MCA. Moreover, there are numerous implementing regulations governing the Game Farms which control virtually every aspect of the Game Farm industry. <em>See </em>Admin R. M. §§ 32.4.101-1320 (2008).</p>
    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[175,1054,1323,765]]]'>¶9 Because 1-143 eliminated the in-state market for fee-shooting and impaired the profitability of their Game Farm operations, the Kafkas challenged the validity of 1-143 in District Court. On April 5, 2002, the Kafkas filed suit against the State and FWP, challenging the lawfulness and constitutionality of 1-143 on a variety of grounds. On May 8, 2002, appellees-intervenors Sportsmen for 1-143 and Montana Wildlife Federation were permitted to intervene, opposing the Kafkas. On October 21, 2002, the District Court dismissed six of the seven counts alleged in the original complaint, none of which are on appeal before this Court. The remaining claim concerned whether the passage and implementation of 1-143 resulted in a taking of various property interests held by the Kafkas under Article II, Section 29 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The property interests allegedly taken by 1-143 included the Kafkas’ animals, Licenses, real property, improvements, business, goodwill and livelihoods.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[171,1834,1327,333]]]'>¶10 As litigation before the District Court proceeded, the Bridgewaters and Boumas were granted leave to intervene and join the Kafkas in challenging I-143’s constitutionality. On February 25,2003, the District Court bifurcated the legal proceedings and decided the takings claims would be determined separately. If the District Court found a taking had occurred, it would then submit the determination of damages to a jury.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.7",108,[176,2174,1322,187]],["BL_109.1",109,[86,326,1330,332]]]'>¶11 On May 19 and 20, 2004, the District Court held a bench trial on appellants’ takings claims under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions. In the course of this trial, the District Court received voluminous testimony and evidence. On February 8,2005, the District Court issued <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>a detailed and comprehensive order containing seventy-three findings of fact and fifty-one conclusions of law and ultimately denied appellants’ takings claims. The District Court held that the enactment and enforcement of 1-143 did not amount to a compensable taking of appellants’ private property under the Montana or U.S. Constitutions. Judgment was rendered against appellants and they have timely appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b109-3" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[83,667,1329,1207]]]'>¶12 Appellants challenge the District Court’s order in several respects. We describe the rationale underlying the order in broad terms to convey a sense of the District Court’s reasoning and analysis. First, we turn to the relevant portions of the District Court’s findings of fact. The District Court found that all parties knew the Game Farm industry was highly regulated, existing only by virtue of legislative permission, and that the legislature reserved the ability to change the regulations governing Game Farms at all times. The District Court pointed to specific portions of the EA prepared for the Kafkas’ operations in which FWP warned them of public unrest regarding Game Farms due to the threat posed by CWD and their negative impact on Montana’s fair chase hunting tradition. For instance, in the EA prepared in 1996, FWP specifically noted that “[t]here are many people who would like to see game farming prohibited in Montana. Some of these people belong to organizations that will probably continue their efforts to have legislation passed to eliminate game farming.” In the EA for the Kafkas’ second License, FWP noted much public concern on the negative effect that Game Farms have on Montana’s hunting heritage and the sport of hunting in Montana. However, FWP also noted that game farms were legitimate, regulated activities, approved by the legislature, and that it had “no authority to regulate game farms based solely on public sentiment.” Although there was no evidence that the Boumas or Bridgewaters received these same warnings, the District Court found that they knew, or should have known, about the tentative status of Game Farms in Montana.</p>
    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[83,1891,1325,479]],["BL_110.1",110,[177,323,1326,577]]]'>¶13 The District Court also issued findings concerning the economic effect of 1-143 with respect to appellants’ property interests. On the one hand, the District Court found appellants’ real estate retained significant value in spite of 1-143 and that some of appellants’ lands had appreciated in value since initially purchased. With respect to the Kafkas, the District Court found that the “highest and best use” of the land associated with their original breeder operation was as “a small tract of range land, with a possible conversion to a rural home site with adjoining pasture.” Its value for this use as of November 7, 2000, was $34,720. The second property’s “highest and best use” was found to be <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>as “rangeland with recreational influences, used for the production of livestock and a potential homesite,” and its value as of November 7, 2000, was $336,000. Although the Kafkas argued that covenants in the title documents prevented such a use, the District Court was not persuaded by their evidence on this point. The District Court also took notice of the fact that the covenants in question had already been lifted by agreement entered into between the Kafkas and Hill County on March 29, 2004. Further, the District Court rejected expert testimony presented by the Kafkas that the “highest and best use” of their lands was as Game Farms, finding that their expert testimony failed to conform to the standards established under the uniform standards for professional appraisal practice.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[177,906,1323,431]]]'>¶14 With respect to the Bridgewaters’ property, the District Court similarly found that its “highest and best use” was as a “recreational ranch,” and that the value of the land, improvements, and fixtures was $945,000 as of November 7, 2000. This was an approximately 100% appreciation in the value of the land since initially purchased in 1990. The District Court observed that the Bridgewaters did not provide expert testimony regarding the value of the land and its fixtures, or its highest and best use, and that their expert specifically denied having appraised any of the Bridgewaters’ tangible real or personal property.</p>
    <p id="AmL" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[178,1345,1322,480]]]'>¶15 The District Court found the “highest and best use” of the Boumas’ property to be for “agricultural production with the potential for future development for industrial or rural use.” Its valuation for these uses as of November 7, 2000, was $258,000. This represented the value of the two original lots, now worth $87,000, and the third lot worth $171,000. These figures also represented a notable appreciation in the value of the Boumas’ lands. Further, the District Court observed that the Boumas, like the Bridgewaters, provided no testimony as to the value of the land, its fixtures, its highest and best use, nor did they provide an expert appraisal of their tangible real or personal property.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.7",110,[178,1833,1322,378]]]'>¶16 The District Court did, however, find that appellants’ alternative livestock suffered a substantial loss in value as a result of 1-143. As the District Court noted, before 1-143, the Kafkas could fetch $5,000 to $6,000 per head of alternative livestock by virtue of fee-shooting. After 1-143, each head of livestock was worth only between $1,700 and $1,800 in out-of-state markets. Although there was testimony of even greater devaluations of the livestock of the Boumas and Bridgewaters, the District Court did not refer to these in its order. <em>See </em>¶ 84.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.8",110,[178,2222,1322,136]],["BL_111.1",111,[79,331,1325,285]]]'>¶17 The District Court then issued findings suggesting that this particular economic impact could be mitigated. The District Court noted that there still remained out-of-state markets for alternative livestock, <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>and that appellants could harvest the alternative livestock for their meat and antlers. For instance, the Bridgewaters had been able to sell a herd of 160 of their alternative livestock to an out-of-state concern for approximately $80,000. The District Court also noted that none of the appellants had indicated any taxable profit on their tax returns, thus implying that their businesses were not profitable to begin with.</p>
    <p id="b111-3" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[77,624,1326,530]]]'>¶18 Ultimately, the District Court’s findings suggest that the Kafkas suffered the greatest economic impact, the Bridgewaters somewhat less, while the Boumas suffered no direct economic impact at all. The District Court tempered these conclusions by observing that all appellants either knew, or should have known, that Game Farms were highly controversial in Montana and that they were obliged to comply with any changes in the governing laws. Further, the District Court found that 1-143 served a legitimate state interest, insofar as it promoted Montana’s hunting heritage, protected wild game populations from the spread of disease and hybridization, and thus generally protected the sport of hunting in Montana.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[76,1163,1331,531]]]'>¶19 In its conclusions of law, the District Court examined each of appellants’ property interests separately to determine if they had been taken by 1-143. The District Court began by considering whether appellants’ Licenses and intangible business assets (i.e., good will and going-concern value) were compensable property interests<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> under the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29. After reviewing the pertinent authorities, the District Court concluded that the Licenses were not compensable property interests and therefore could not be “taken.” With respect to appellants’ intangible business assets, the District Court concluded they were not taken because such interests are not compensable in the regulatory taking context.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[74,1701,1327,382]],["BL_112.1",112,[185,327,166,33]]]'>¶20 The District Court acknowledged that the land, alternative livestock, and other physical assets were compensable property interests, but ultimately found that none of these compensable property interests were taken by I-143. The District Court rejected the argument that appellants had suffered a “categorical taking” under <em>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=505%20U.S.%201003" class="citation" data-index="0">505 U.S. 1003</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=112%20S.%20Ct.%202886" class="citation" data-index="1">112 S. Ct. 2886</a> (1992), because these items continued to retain economic value, even if greatly diminished; thus, the conditions necessary for applying the <em>Lucas </em>analysis were not <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>satisfied.</p>
    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[182,374,1324,1019]]]'>¶21 The District Court then went on to consider whether there was a taking under the factors-based analysis from <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=438%20U.S.%20104" class="citation" data-index="2">438 U.S. 104</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=98%20S.%20Ct.%202646" class="citation" data-index="3">98 S. Ct. 2646</a> (1978).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> On the one hand, the District Court failed to see any evidence of an economic impact on appellants’ land and fixtures as a result of 1-143. In this regard, the District Court noted that appellants failed to provide any expert appraisals to demonstrate the impact of 1-143 on their real estate interests. However, the District Court did recognize a significant impact on appellants’ alternative livestock. Overall, however, the District Court concluded that any reasonable investment-backed expectations appellants may have had regarding their Game Farms had to be tempered against the reality that they were operating in a highly regulated, controversial field, where the State was free to change the regulatory environment. In short, appellants should have reasonably anticipated that something like 1-143 was on the horizon. Additionally, the District Court found that the character of the governmental action embodied in 1-143 was a valid exercise of the police power of the State and substantially advanced a number of legitimate state interests. Accordingly, the State had no constitutional duty to compensate appellants for the effects of 1-143, no matter how greatly it impaired the profitability of appellants’ businesses.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[183,1401,1323,722]]]'>¶22 Appellants argue on appeal that several of the District Court’s findings were clearly erroneous. The Kafkas, for instance, argue that the District Court improperly relied on tax return information to conclude that their businesses suffered no significant economic impact as a result of 1-143. Additionally, they argue that the evidence before the District Court showed that there was no viable out-of-state market for their alternative livestock or their by-products, and that after 1-143 they could only sell these animals at a loss. They also argue the District Court improperly relied upon on the various “highest and best use” appraisals for their parcels of land provided by the State’s experts.

Both versions of part 4 state that the licensee may breed, harvest, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock, so long as she “complies with the requirement of this part.” Both versions of part 4 specifically state that FWP may revoke the Licenses if the operator fails “to operate an alternative livestock ranch according to the provisions of this part, rules adopted under this part, or stipulations of the alternative livestock ranch license.” Section 87-4-427(l)(a), MCA. Thus, nothing in part 4 limits the ability or discretion of FWP or the State to make changes to the statute. Additionally, the Licenses issued to all appellants stated that they were subject to the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>“general requirements of the game farm statutes and rules for Montana Fish, Wildlife, &amp; Parks and the Montana Department of Livestock....” ¶50 More importantly, nothing in the Licenses or part 4 expressly revokes the ability of the State to alter those Licenses via duly enacted statutory amendments or changes. In this regard, we note the operation of§ 1-2-110, MCA, entitled “All statutes subject to repeal,” which states: “Any statute may be repealed at any time except when it is otherwise provided therein. Persons acting under any statute are deemed to have acted in contemplation of this power of repeal.” Section 1-2-110, MCA. As the District Court correctly held, the ability to operate a Game Farm is not a common law right incident to the ownership of real property, and is legal only by virtue of legislative enactment. “That the ownership of wild animals is in the state, held by it in its sovereign capacity for the use and benefit of the people generally, and that neither such animals nor parts thereof are subject to private ownership except in so far as the state may choose to make them so, are principles now too firmly established to be open to controversy.” <em>Rosenfeld v.

In cases such as <em>Kimball, </em>where there is an actual physical occupation of land by the government, fundamental property rights are implicated; thus, if the going-concern value is based upon a right or ability to exclusive use of the property which the government is occupying, it makes sense to provide compensation for the value lost. Turning to this case, it is important to note that appellants cite no authority for the proposition that compensation of the loss of their intangible assets should be paid under their regulatory takings claims. Any citation to <em>Kimball </em>is unavailing for the simple reason that <em>Kimball </em>involved actual physical occupation of land-a critical fact which is absent in this case.</p>

In light of <em>Lingle, </em>appellants’ argue it is legally inappropriate to conduct a “means-ends” analysis to determine whether 1-143 substantially advances legitimate state interests. Instead, they argue, the proper focus should be on the nature of the interference with appellants’ property interests and whether 1-143 requires appellants to unfairly shoulder the economic <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>burden of eliminating the in-state market for fee-shooting.</p>

    <p id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.8",132,[184,859,1326,774]]]'>¶81 The State presented expert testimony and evidence at trial which showed that the “highest and best use” of appellants’ lands were for uses other than Game Farms, and that they all retained significant value in spite of 1-143; indeed, most of those lands even appreciated. Other than simply disagreeing with this view, appellants offered no evidence-such as appraisals of their own-to support the contention that these findings were clearly erroneous. Indeed, appellants’ experts admitted at trial that they had conducted no appraisals of the real property or fixtures themselves. Instead, appellants presented expert testimony to the effect that 1-143 constituted a categorical taking of their businesses and the Licenses themselves. But the District Court was correct to give no weight to this expert testimony, because those interests are not compensable under the circumstances at bar. Moreover, a review of the expert opinions presented by appellants shows that these experts did not understand how the <em>Penn Central </em>takings analysis is actually applied by the courts.</p>

Additionally, while the Kafkas contended that certain restrictive covenants in their title documents precluded the alternative uses which the State’s appraisal deemed appropriate, the District Court adequately addressed this issue by taking notice of the fact that these covenants had been removed by the Kafkas and Hill County, and did not impair the marketability of their lands for uses other than Game Farms.</p>

In short, they provide no basis to assert a taking of their real estate interests, regardless of the weight of the remaining two factors.

    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[78,614,1330,968]]]'>¶84 Next we turn to appellants’ claim that their alternative livestock was “taken” by 1-143. Returning to the <em>Penn Central </em>analysis, we will first examine the economic impact of 1-143. In this connection, we agree with appellants that the District Court underestimated the economic impact that 1-143 had on their alternative livestock. Unlike their real estate interests, appellants’ have demonstrated that their alternative livestock suffered a significant devaluation as a result of 1-143. Prior to 1-143, the Kafkas received approximately $5,000 to $6,000 per head of alternative livestock; after 1-143 that figure was reduced to $1,700 to $1,800. This represented a devaluation of roughly 70%. The District Court had evidence before it suggesting similar or greater devaluations for both the Bridgewaters and the Boumas, although it did not cite to this evidence in its order. According to the record, the Bridgewaters once had received approximately $8,000 to $9,000 for each head, while after 1-143 they sold 160 head to an out-of-state interest for approximately $80,000, representing a price of around $500 per head, or a roughly 95% devaluation. The Boumas had sold their animals for roughly $5,000 a head before 1-143, while after its passage they received $500 per head. These figures show a devaluation in the neighborhood of 90%.</p>
    <p id="b133-5" data-blocks='[["BL_133.6",133,[77,1592,1324,423]]]'>¶85 Moreover, the facts in the record support the view that this diminished value was insufficient to even cover the cost of raising and maintaining those livestock. While there do exist some markets for their alternative livestock either for meat or antlers, or for resale to out-of-state markets, the return from such activities is less than the actual cost of maintaining the alternative livestock. In other words, after I-143, appellants could only sell the alternative livestock at a loss. This factor weighs in favor of finding a compensable taking of appellants’ alternative livestock.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.7",133,[76,2031,1329,334]],["BL_134.1",134,[178,317,1322,287]]]'>¶86 We turn next to the second <em>Penn Central </em>factor, the “character of the governmental action.” We start with the proposition that 1-143 places the economic burden of eliminating Game Farms in Montana squarely on the shoulders of individuals, like the appellants, who have entered into this industry in reliance on the continued legality of fee-shooting. As such, it seems to run afoul of one of the primary policy concerns animating takings jurisprudence, namely the notion that the <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>Takings Clause “bar[s] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=364%20U.S.%2040" class="citation" data-index="172">364 U.S. 40</a>, 49, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=80%20S.%20Ct.%201563" class="citation" data-index="173">80 S. Ct. 1563</a>, 1569 (1960). Whatever the rationale for preventing fee-shooting, it is clear that individuals like appellants, and not the public as a whole, are being asked to bear the burden.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[179,611,1326,1018]]]'>¶87 However, the type of intrusion upon the alternative livestock embodied by 1-143 is minimal. The animals have not been seized by virtue of I-143-they still belong to the appellants. Moreover, Appellants may still sell their animals to out-of-state markets for any usage, and may even allow others to shoot them in Montana, so long as no fee is charged. It is well-established that regulations which impair or significantly decrease the profitable use of property do not amount to a taking. In <em>Andrus, </em>for instance, the Supreme Court held that an act of Congress which banned the sale and transfer of eagle feathers, did not amount to a taking of the eagle feathers because the property holders still maintained the rest of the bundle of rights, and could still make some minimal use of the eagle feathers. <em>Andrus, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=444%20U.S.%20164" class="citation" data-index="174">444 U.S. at 65-66</a>, 100 S. Ct. at 327. The Supreme Court acknowledged that the act deprived claimants of the ability to make profitable use of the eagle feathers, but declined to find a taking in large measure because they did not have a right, under the Takings Clause to make profitable use of the eagle feathers. “[T]he denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full ‘bundle’ of property rights, the destruction of one ‘strand’ of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety.” <em>Andrus, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=444%20U.S.%20164" class="citation" data-index="175">444 U.S. at 65-66</a>, 100 S.

If the nature of the intrusion was greater and 1-143 affected other segments of appellants’ bundle of rights in the alternative livestock, such as their right to sell the live animals or slaughter them for market, then this factor might lean more in their favor because appellants, and not the general public, are shouldering this burden. As it stands, however, the intrusion is so slight that this factor must weigh against finding a compensable taking.</p>

Indeed, that is why they expended significant financial resources on their respective operations to begin with. The District Court acknowledged these expectations but concluded that they “must be legally tempered by the objective reality that they <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>were engaged in a highly regulated and speculative new industry.” While one can maintain reasonable investment-backed expectations in highly-regulated industries, <em>e.g., Ruckleshaus, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=467%20U.S.%20986" class="citation" data-index="176">467 U.S. at 1010-11</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=104%20S.%20Ct.%202862" class="citation" data-index="177">104 S.

In this case, then, the question becomes whether it was reasonable for appellants to maintain an investment-backed expectation that they would always be able to charge a fee to shoot alternative livestock in Montana, and that the State could or would not interfere with this expectation. We find that such an expectation is not reasonable; thus, this factor weighs against finding a compensable taking of appellants’ alternative livestock.</p>

This congressional action was significant to the owners because so long as they participated in the HUD loan program, they were forced to charge rental rates far below market value.

Further, we agree with the District Court that appellants knew, or should have known, that Game Farm operations were highly controversial in Montana and that initiative measures could have been passed which would outlaw Game Farms entirely. The record is clear that FWP was aware of the significant public unrest and imparted this information to the Kafkas beginning in 1996. <em>See </em>¶ 12. Other appellants should have been aware of these same facts. Nothing in the regulations, Licenses, or statutes, provides any assurance that the regulations could not be changed and appellants received no guarantees from the State that their operations would continue to be lawful.</p>

In other words, appellants could not maintain a reasonable investment-backed expectation that they would be permanently insulated against the possibility that the Game Farm industry would be either regulated so as to eliminate its profitability, or completely abolished. As a result, since appellants could have reasonably anticipated the complete elimination of Game Farms by the State or regulations that would make participation in the field unprofitable, they should have also anticipated that the State could make the operations less profitable by eliminating the in-state market for fee-shooting. Although appellants may not have specifically anticipated the passage and enactment of I-143, the practical effect of I-143-i.e., the elimination of the in-state market for fee-shooting-should have been within their reasonable investment-backed expectations, given the absence of assurances on this point from the State. Accordingly, the “reasonable investment-backed expectation” factor weighs against finding a compensable taking of appellants’ livestock.</p>

As recently as 1999, the State suggested this as “a viable economic opportunity” for any private property owner, as well as the traditional livestock producers who were interested in diversifying their ranch productivity. Although the State regulated alternative livestock ranching, the regulatory scheme provided that these businesses could continue so long as the owner paid the licensing fee each year and complied with all recording and reporting requirements. Among other things, the State sanctioned “fee shooting,” where members of the public could pay to shoot a preselected animal on an alternative livestock ranch under the supervision of a guide. <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>Indisputably, fee shooting was the primary source of income for the alternative livestock businesses.</p>

But then the State turned around and told the Ranchers that while they could continue to acquire, breed, and harvest their alternative livestock, they could no longer charge a fee for hunting the livestock. In thus prohibiting remuneration for the key economic activity on which the Ranchers’ businesses depended, the State effectively legislated those businesses out of existence. The State zeroed out the Ranchers’ intangible assets (e.g., goodwill and going-concern value) and left them with a collection of tangibles whose value was either worthless or substantially diminished.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[182,993,1322,821]]]'>¶99 The Court holds today that the Ranchers are not entitled under the United States Constitution or the Montana Constitution to any compensation for the obliteration of their businesses caused by the passage of Initiative No. 143 (“Initiative” or “1-143”) in November 2000. The Court acknowledges that the Ranchers suffered substantial property devaluation as a result of the Initiative, but the Court decides that such loss is not compensable because the State did not physically condemn or occupy the Ranchers’ property and because the Ranchers should have anticipated a prohibition on charging a fee for alternative livestock hunts. As will surely come as a surprise to many Montana business owners, the Court announces that, absent an explicit “assurance” from the State, the businessman or businesswoman has no reasonable expectation in being able to receive remuneration for the goods and services he or she provides. Thus, when the State says, “Go ahead and market your products, but don’t charge anything for them,” the business owner is simply out of luck if his or her business is destroyed as a result.</p>
    <p id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.7",138,[181,1823,1323,382]]]'>¶100 At bottom, the Court holds that any individual in this State who, with the State’s encouragement, invests capital and resources to create a going concern, but who does so in a field that this Court considers “highly controversial,” simply has no compensable interest in that business. Therefore, when the State up and decides to legislate the business out of existence-through the unique expedient of depriving the business of any income-the State need not provide any compensation for the owner’s loss of property.</p>

Laws of Montana 1917, ch. 173, § 84, <em>as amended, </em>Laws of Montana 1919, ch. 200, § 1, <em>codified at </em>§ 3777, RCM (1921). The business owner was required to pay an annual license fee and comply with any regulations prescribed by the State Fish and Game Commission. In addition, a statement of the place where “such business” was to be conducted and the game proposed to be raised on said premises had to be filed with the Commission. Section 3777, RCM. To this end, upon obtaining a permit from the Commission, the business owner was authorized “to capture alive such ... game quadrupeds as may be necessary for foundation stock for such game farm.” Section 3777, RCM. <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>Finally, once the game farm was “in successful operation,” the owner was authorized to “sell, transfer, or dispose of the game so bred and raised by him, as he might do with domestic live stock, and without restriction so to do.” Section 3777, RCM.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[174,511,1322,771]]]'>¶104 The statutory scheme underwent a number of revisions in 1925, 1933, and 1947. Most of these changes are not pertinent to the instant appeal, though the following are worth noting. In 1925, the Legislature added an explicit fencing requirement and made it unlawful for any person to enter a properly fenced game farm without the owner’s consent. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana 1925, ch. 192, § 31. The Legislature also provided that “the product of such game or fur-farm may be dealt with and sold as private property,” Laws of Montana 1925, ch. 192, § 31, <em>codified at </em>§ 3777, RCM (1935); however, this language was not carried forward in the 1947 version of the statute, <em>see </em>§ 26-1201, RCM (1947). In 1947, the Legislature clarified that a permit must be procured “before” establishing a game farm but that a game farm permit “shall” be issued to “responsible” applicants who own or lease, and have properly fenced, the premises on which their operations are to be conducted. Laws of Montana 1947, ch. 120, § 1. Thereafter, the statutory scheme remained substantially unchanged through 1982.</p>

The culmination of the task force’s work, Senate Bill No. 448 (“SB 448”), was passed by the 1983 Legislature. It repealed the existing game farm laws and replaced them with an entirely new statutory framework. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana 1983, ch. 570. Among other things, the new scheme clarified that all game farm animals lawfully raised on a licensed game farm “are the private property of the licensee,” § 87-4-414(1), MCA (1983); that the licensee “may acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, capture, kill, use, sell, or dispose of the game farm animals and their progeny in any quantity, at any time of year, and in any manner, as long as he complies with the requirements of [Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA],” § 87-4-414(2), MCA; and that the laws applicable to <em>game </em>animals do not apply to <em>game farm </em>animals on a licensed game farm, § 87-4-414(4), MCA. The hunting and sale of game farm animals was explicitly recognized in §§ 87-4-414(3), -415(1), and -421, MCA. Persons wishing to operate a game farm were still required to obtain a license, <em>see </em>§§ 87-4-407, -409, MCA; however, once obtained, renewal of the license was a matter of right “upon payment of the renewal fee if the licensee has not violated any provision under which <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>the license was granted,” § 87-4-412(1), MCA.

    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[93,466,1332,1115]]]'>¶106 Notably, the original version of SB 448 differed in a number of critical respects from the proposed legislation submitted by the Game Farm Task Force. Among other things, the drafters of SB 448 gave the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks discretion as to whether a game farm license would be issued (assuming the game farm application was otherwise in order) by replacing the word “shall” with the word “may” in several places. The drafters also revised the provision regarding the renewal of licenses such that renewal would not be a matter of right. These sorts of changes prompted a somewhat scathing rejoinder by counsel representing the interests of game farm operators. In a February 1983 letter (which is part of the legislative history of SB 448), counsel pointed out that the proposed legislation submitted by the drafters “violated the intent” of the proposed legislation submitted by the Game Farm Task Force. At stake here, he stated, was “the private property right that every individual has to raise livestock as long as he complies with the other provisions of the Act as was discussed in the task force.” Counsel stated that unless the language of SB 448 was amended so that “it represents what the task force agreed upon and does not take away any rights that we negotiated,” he would oppose the bill. Ultimately, his concerns were taken into account, and the final version of SB 448 passed by the Legislature, as described above, included the “rights” sought by the game farm operators and negotiated by the Game Farm Task Force.</p>

The Legislature also eliminated the “shooting license” that game farmers had been required to obtain before allowing anyone to hunt on their property. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana 1993, ch. 315, § 7. In 1999, the term “game farm” was changed to “alternative livestock ranch.” <em>See </em>Laws of Montana 1999, ch. 574, § 7. In addition, the Legislature added a provision explicitly recognizing the production of alternative livestock as “a viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.” Laws of <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>Montana 1999, ch. 574, § 1.</p>

All alternative livestock lawfully possessed on a licensed alternative livestock ranch were the licensee’s “private property,” which the licensee could “breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of ... in any quantity and at any time of year.” Section 87-4-414(1), (2) MCA (1999). Annual renewal of the alternative livestock ranch license was a matter of right under § 87-4-412(1), MCA, which instructed the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks to renew each license “upon payment of the renewal fee if the licensee has complied with all recording and reporting requirements.” Lastly, each license was transferable if certain criteria were met.

Furthermore, while the regulations designed to protect native wildlife (through safety and fencing requirements) became increasingly detailed and rigorous, so did the regulations designed to protect the business owners’ interests (through explicit recognition of their alternative livestock as “private property” and their businesses as “viable economic opportunities,” and through the guarantee that their licenses would be renewed each year upon payment of the renewal fee and compliance with all recording and reporting requirements).</p>

They assert that these “additional restrictions” are not so onerous as to amount to a taking of private property. The District Court likewise characterized 1-143 as merely an <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>“extension” of the existing regulatory framework. Remarkably, this Court minimizes the impact of 1-143 even further, declaring it to be only a “slight” and “minimally intrusive” burden on the Ranchers’ property interests. For the reasons which follow, these characterizations are baseless and patently misleading.</p>
    <p id="b143-3" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[84,560,1326,1213]]]'>¶112 The Sportsmen inform us that they conceived, designed, and drafted 1-143 “to address specific dangers stemming from the proliferation of game farms in this state.” They list a number of such dangers: the threat posed by alternative livestock ranches to Montana’s “proud heritage of ethical hunting”; the increased risk of disease (e.g., chronic wasting disease), hybridization, and competition to native wildlife posed by alternative livestock interacting with native elk and deer (as a result of escape, or nose-to-nose contact through the fence); and the “European style” privatization of wildlife. The Sportsmen also report that they opposed and sought to prohibit the “penned hunts” offered by many alternative livestock ranches. They note that this practice, which they criticize as “a sport for the wealthy,” had become a “poster child” for anti-hunting groups. Finally, although the Legislature took action in 2000 to address concerns over chronic wasting disease-see Laws of Montana 2001, May 2000 Special Session, ch. 1 (imposing a moratorium on new applications for initial alternative livestock ranch licenses “until a live test for chronic wasting disease is developed and is approved by the department of livestock”)-the Sportsmen assert that “the problems” associated with alternative livestock ranches were not “adequately addressed” by the legislative action. The Sportsmen thus characterize 1-143 as “vital” to the protection of Montana’s wildlife, to the availability of plentiful populations of big game, and to the preservation of Montana’s proud tradition of hunting these animals under fair-chase conditions. They conclude that 1-143 serves “weighty” and “important” purposes.</p>

As a matter of fact, the Initiative does not prohibit the Ranchers from continuing to acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of alternative livestock. Section 87-4-414(2), MCA (2001). The Initiative allows the Ranchers to keep penned elk, in spite of the concern about contact between wild ungulates and alternative livestock and the concern about transmission of diseases through intermediate hosts. The Initiative also allows <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>“penned hunts,” in spite of the concern with preserving Montana’s tradition of ethical fair-chase hunting. And the Initiative allows private ownership of alternative livestock, § 87-4-414(1), MCA, in spite of the concern over European-style privatization of wildlife. In short, 1-143 neither outlawed alternative livestock ranches nor directly addressed any of the concerns cited by the Sportsmen in support of the Initiative. (The Sportsmen’s concerns were set out in the Proponents’ arguments included with the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet.) 1-143 did not create new regulations concerning fencing, it did not create new testing requirements for diseases, and people can still shoot privately owned penned elk. 1-143 actually addressed none of the “weighty” and “important” purposes for which it was promoted to the voters.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[175,893,1322,234]]]'>¶114 The reason for all of this is simple: The Sportsmen’s ultimate goal was to shut down all alternative livestock businesses, and in drafting 1-143, they recognized the constitutional implications of doing so outright. As explained by counsel for the Sportsmen during oral argument in the companion case, <em>Buhmann v. State </em>(No. 05-473):</p>
    <blockquote id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.6",144,[265,1136,1232,333]]]'>There was a recognition by my clients that if they passed a statute that simply said, “Every game farm is done tomorrow,” that that would be a very difficult takings claim to defend against.

They recognized that because the value of each alternative livestock business derived from its ability to sell “penned hunts,” 1-143 would effectively shut those businesses down by prohibiting remuneration for such hunts. Indeed, as the District Court aptly observed: “1-143 does appear to have been intentionally crafted in such a way that would for all intents and purposes snuff out alternative livestock ranching and in the process possibly save the State from footing the bill in the event it was found that the obvious takings were compensable.” Likewise, despite its attempts elsewhere in the Opinion to minimize the impact of 1-143, the Court acknowledges that the Initiative’s prohibition on fee shooting effectively “outlaw[ed] Game Farms entirely.” Opinion, ¶ 92. Similarly, the Attorney General’s explanatory statement of 1-143 in the 2000 Voter Information Pamphlet points out that “[ajbolishing fee shooting may force closure of some game farms.” Notably absent from the Voter <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>Information Pamphlet, however, is any acknowledgement that the State might have to foot the bill for destroying the Ranchers’ property rights. As a result, the voters were never required to weigh the costs and benefits of taking the Ranchers’ property. They were simply asked whether an initiative “prohibiting new game farms, prohibiting transfer of existing game farm licenses, and prohibiting shooting of game farm animals for a fee” should be approved, given the dire public need described by the Proponents.</p>
    <p id="b145-3" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[97,709,1326,481]]]'>¶116 In blunt terms, the Sportsmen determined to rid Montana of a perceived blight, but euthanizing the Ranchers outright was thought to be too “offensive” and costly. So, they decided instead to pull the plug on the Ranchers’ life-support. That way, they could argue that the Ranchers died of natural causes and that the State, therefore, bears no responsibility. Counsel’s assertion that this transparent charade is “not offensive” to the guarantee of just compensation for a taking of private property is dubious, if not preposterous. Moreover, that this ruse was wrapped in the mantle of Montana’s “proud heritage of ethical hunting” is a stain on the sport that the Sportsmen purport to protect.</p>

This constitutional guarantee is worthless when the Court allows it to be circumvented by means of a “carefully crafted” political ploy. Moreover, the purpose of the constitutional guarantee is undermined when property rights can be devalued with no thought whatsoever as to the burdens and benefits involved. From the taxpayers’ perspective, it is easy and painless to vote for an initiative such as 1-143 when this Court holds that the government is free to take property without having to pay for it. Yet, if government regulation involves “adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good,” <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=438%20U.S.%20104" class="citation" data-index="197">438 U.S. 104</a>, 124, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=98%20S.%20Ct.%202646" class="citation" data-index="198">98 S.

Opinion, ¶ 93. The purpose of 1-143, as admitted <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>by the Sportsmen themselves, was not to create a few “additional restrictions” (e.g., new testing and fencing regulations) that might incidentally make the business of alternative livestock ranching less profitable. The Initiative’s purpose, rather, was to eliminate the economic viability of these businesses entirely and thereby make it unfeasible for the Ranchers and other alternative livestock business owners to operate their ranches at all. In this connection, the Sportsmen and the Court concede that the Ranchers invested in specialized equipment, inventory, and fixtures and expended significant financial resources to develop their property for the <em>specific </em>purpose of fee shooting. Moreover, the Court acknowledges that as a result of I-143, the value of the Ranchers’ alternative livestock was diminished to such an extent that the Ranchers are no longer able to cover the cost of raising and maintaining the livestock. Opinion, ¶ 85. Simply put, 1-143 was designed to shut down all alternative livestock businesses, and it succeeded in doing so. It is irrelevant that this was accomplished in a less direct and expeditious manner than passing a statute that simply said, “Every game farm is done tomorrow.” The result-destruction of the Ranchers’ businesses-is clearly the same.</p>

Rather, the point of this discussion is that 1-143 was intended to shut down the alternative livestock industry without the State’s having to pay for it, and thus the Sportsmen’s and the Court’s portrayals of 1-143 as something other than it is-as merely a slight, minimally intrusive “adjustment” of the regulatory scheme-are implausible. Indeed, they are flat wrong. The Court even contradicts itself by arguing on one hand that 1-143 amounts to a “slight” and “minimally intrusive” burden on the Ranchers’ property interests, Opinion, ¶ 88, but on the other hand that the Ranchers “should have reasonably anticipated that the Game Farm industry might be phased out,” Opinion, ¶ 93. “Phasing out” an entire industry is certainly not the result one would reasonably anticipate from a regulation whose intrusion on property interests is “slight” and “minimally intrusive.”</p>

Alternative livestock ranching, which was done and maintained under the express authority of Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA, was in no way a public nuisance. <em>See </em>§ 27-30-101(2), MCA (“Nothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.”). <em>Mugler, </em>therefore, is inapposite.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[174,807,1323,869]]]'>¶130 The State suggested otherwise at oral argument, asserting emphatically and with unmistakable disdain that use of alternative livestock for the purpose of fee shooting threatened the public health, safety, and welfare. Likewise, in its appellate brief, the State disparages the Ranchers’ activities as “injurious to public health, safety, and welfare.” That the State would describe alternative livestock ranching with such smug intolerance is astounding, given that the State not only sanctioned the industry’s existence for 83 years but also facilitated-and even encouraged-the establishment of numerous alternative livestock businesses. Indeed, the State conceded at oral argument that “[t]here is some evidence to suggest that it was the policy of the political branches of government to encourage people to look at game farming as an alternative to traditional agriculture-actually, to subsidize traditional agriculture so they could stay on the farms and ranches.” Yet, at the same time, the State argued that the very activities it had sanctioned and encouraged for 83 years needed to be prohibited in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. This is hypocrisy personified.</p>

Assuming, arguendo, that 1-143 reflects a determination by the State that fee shooting is a noxious use of property, it has long been established that the mere declaration by the government that a certain property or use thereof constitutes a nuisance does not make it so. <em>See Yates v.

This would place every house, every business, and all the property of the city, at the uncontrolled will of the temporary local authorities. Yet this seems to have been the view taken by counsel who defended this case in the Circuit Court; for that single ordinance of the city, declaring the wharf of Yates a nuisance, and ordering its abatement, is the only evidence in the record that it is a nuisance or an obstruction to navigation, or in any manner injurious to the public.</blockquote>

There exists in the State’s and the Sportsmen’s briefs, and in the Court’s Opinion as well, an undertone that alternative livestock ranchers are bad people who were engaged in an offensive business and deserved to be shut down. This undertone is not properly a part of the takings calculus. Montana has many businesses that strike some citizens as ill-advised or repugnant for one reason or another.

Broadly speaking, the issue we must decide on this appeal is whether the governmental action embodied in 1-143 amounted to a “taking” of the Ranchers’ property. In answering this question, relevant considerations include “the actual burden imposed on property rights” and “how that burden is allocated.” <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=544%20U.S.%20528" class="citation" data-index="244">544 U.S. 528</a>, 543, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=125%20S.%20Ct.%202074" class="citation" data-index="245">125 S.

In contrast, whether 1-143 “substantially advances legitimate state interests” or is “reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose” is irrelevant, since such considerations are pertinent to a due process analysis, not a takings analysis. <em>See Lingle, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=544%20U.S.%20528" class="citation" data-index="246">544 U.S. at 540-42</a>, 125 S.

Indeed, the Sportsmen consume roughly a third of their appellate brief expounding on “I-143’s purposes and the importance of those purposes.” The Sportsmen conclude that the “weighty” and “important” purposes served by 1-143 “tip the scales” against the State’s having to pay compensation for any diminution in the value of the Ranchers’ property.</p>

Nevertheless, the State contends that 1-143 is “a valid police power regulation that substantially advances a number of important interests.” Likewise, the District Court observed that 1-143 is “a valid police power regulation that reasonably advances the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the State and its citizens” and that “[t]he State introduced unrebutted evidence that 1-143 advances substantial state interests.” The District Court concluded that these factors “weigh <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>heavily against requiring the State to pay compensation here.”</p>

Thus, as the Ranchers correctly point out, it is improper (for purposes of analyzing their takings claims) to conduct a “means-ends” analysis of 1-143 and the District Court, therefore, erred in factoring due process considerations into its analysis. To understand why, it is helpful to begin with some historical background.</p>

The court, however, observed that a highway is an easement conferring on the public only a right of passage and that the landowner retains the fee and “all rights of property” in the land. <em>Woodruff, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=28%20Conn.%20165" class="citation" data-index="260">28 Conn, at 167</a>.

In other words, the City prohibited Yates from maintaining a dock over that part of his land between the dock line and the navigable part of the river, though a dock in this location would not have interfered with the public’s easement. In so doing, the City rendered this section of his property worthless, and the court held that “it would be necessary to make compensation to the owner for the property which would thus be rendered valueless by this act of the common council.” <em>Walker, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=4%20Wis.%20486" class="citation" data-index="270">4 </a></em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=4%20Wis.%20486" class="citation" data-index="270">Wis. at 512</a>; <em>cf.

This, however, is hardly the concession the State makes it out to be. The Ranchers did not “concede” that the protections of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 are “co-extensive.” They merely offered a candid acknowledgement of this Court’s past approach, which is to “look[ ] towards federal jurisprudence when considering takings claims under Montana law” (Opinion, ¶ 31). More importantly, this supposed concession that the protections of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 29 are “co-extensive” does not establish that they are so. This Court, not the Ranchers, determines the “reach” of Article II, Section 29.</p>

The Court’s decision, however, is based entirely on Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. Moreover, although the Ranchers cite Article II, Section 29 as a basis for relief, their corresponding argument is largely undeveloped. <em>Cf. Garrymore, </em>¶¶ 38-39; <em>Rosling, </em>¶ 66. Accordingly, I will analyze the Ranchers’ claims under the Fifth Amendment, rather than Article II, Section 29. In so doing, I will also explain my disagreement with the Court’s corresponding Fifth Amendment analysis. As for Article II, Section 29, the claim that 1-143 effected a taking or damaging of property under the Montana Constitution is better developed by the appellants in the companion case, <em>Buhmann v. State </em>(No. 05-473). Therefore, I will address Article II, Section 29 within the context of that case and explain why that provision entitles the <em>Buhmann </em>appellants to just compensation.</p>

Thus, even though the owners of the escheatable interests had full beneficial use of their property during their lifetimes, they had lost a valuable right associated with those interests. On the other hand, while some of the owners may have purchased their interests with the expectation that they might pass on the remainder to their heirs at death, most of them had acquired their interests by gift, descent, or devise. Thus, the extent to which they had investment-backed expectations in passing on the property was “dubious.” <em>Irving, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=481%20U.S.%20704" class="citation" data-index="443">481 U.S. at 715</a>, 107 S.

The economic impact of this total abrogation is substantial, given that an alternative livestock ranch license is an integral component of an alternative livestock business. No longer may the Ranchers sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their businesses. In this connection, the Bridgewaters point out that prior to the passage of 1-143, they received an offer of $4 million to buy their operation. Following passage, however, the offer was withdrawn, in large part because the license could not be transferred.

In that scenario, a participant in the industry would have been hard-pressed to claim an investment-backed expectation in being able to transfer her license and business. But in 1993, the Legislature granted the right to transfer the licenses. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana 1993, ch. 315, § 6 (substituting “[a] game farm license for a specific facility is transferable” for “[a] game farm license is nontransferable” in § 87-4-412, MCA, effective April 12,1993). The Bridgewaters entered into the alternative livestock business in 1992 and thereafter invested in improvements uniquely designed for operating an alternative livestock business on their property. The Kafkas and the Boumas began investing in their respective operations in 1996. All of the Ranchers had reasonable expectations that they would be able to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their businesses.

The Supreme Court has said that for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, “[property interests] are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.” <em>Ruckelshaus v.

Rather, the Court allows the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to dictate whether a license granted by the State of Montana is protected “property.” <em>See </em>Opinion, ¶ 46 (“As stated in <em>[Members of Peanut Quota Holders Ass’n v.

I do not dispute the validity of the Federal Circuit’s test vis-a-vis federally created property interests. Indeed, all of the cases from which the Federal Circuit synthesized its test involved licenses or permits granted by the federal government. <em>See Members, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=421%20F.3d%201323" class="citation" data-index="461">421 F.3d at 1330-31</a>.

First, as the State acknowledged during oral argument, “it was the policy of the political branches of government to encourage people to look at game farming as an alternative to traditional agriculture-actually, to subsidize traditional agriculture so they could stay on the farms and ranches.” <em>See </em>§ 87-4-431, MCA (1999) (“The legislature recognizes that the production of alternative livestock provides a viable economic opportunity for any private property owner as well as the traditional livestock producers who are interested in diversifying their ranch productivity.”). The licenses were issued and annually renewed in facilitation of this “viable economic opportunity.” Second, renewal of the licenses was a matter of right, upon payment of the renewal fee and compliance with all recording and reporting requirements. Section 87-4-412(1), MCA. Third, the license could not be revoked except if the licensee had violated the law or otherwise engaged in misconduct related to the operation of the alternative livestock ranch. Sections 87-4-423(1), -427(1), MCA. Fourth, the license was transferable. Section 87-4-412(2), MCA.</p>

The Ranchers had statutorily guaranteed security in the continued possession of their licenses and, correspondingly, their ability to pursue this “viable economic opportunity.” It seems patently obvious to me that in their alternative livestock ranch licenses, the Ranchers had property rights which were protected by Montana law and, as such, are deserving of protection under the Takings Clause. <em>Monsanto, </em>467 U.S. at 1003-04, 104 S.

We held in <em>Seven Up Pete </em>that the enactment of 1-137 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking since the Venture had not acquired an operating permit to mine using cyanide prior to I-137’s enactment and since the State retained substantial contractual and regulatory discretion regarding the issuance of such a permit. <em>See Seven Up Pete, </em>¶¶ 32-33. Of particular relevance, we reasoned:</p>
    <blockquote id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[165,1160,1235,335]]]'>[T]he passage of 1-137 did not take away any <em>existing </em>permits or halt any <em>on-going </em>mine operations related to the Venture’s projects. Because the Venture had not obtained the requisite operating permit, it likewise had not obtained a right to mine. Moreover, it was not assured of ever obtaining such a right. Therefore, we conclude that the enactment of 1-137 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking.</blockquote>

      <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>¶ 33 (emphases added). It follows logically from this reasoning that under Montana law, the issuance of a permit or license is a significant act upon which a taking may be premised. Indeed, we dismissed the Venture’s takings claim because it did not have an “existing” permit and because 1-137 did not halt any “on-going” mine operations. In contrast, the Ranchers did have “existing” licenses; annual renewal of the licenses was a matter of right; and 1-143 did halt “on-going” alternative livestock ranching operations-all of which indicates that the Ranchers had compensable property interests in their licenses.</p>

The Court also concedes that neither Title 87, chapter 4, part 4, MCA, nor the licenses themselves contained any express language precluding the formation of a compensable property interest. Opinion, ¶ 48. Instead, the Court points out that a licensee was required to comply with applicable laws and regulations and that the State retained the power to amend the regulations or to revoke the license if the alternative livestock ranch was being operated in violation of the law. Opinion, ¶¶ 49-50. The Court also points out that at common law, wild animals were not subject to private ownership “ ‘except in so far as the state may choose to make them so.’ ” Opinion, ¶ 50 (quoting <em>Rosenfeld v.

These points, however, miss the mark. Indeed, as the Court itself acknowledges in the very next breath, the government does not have the right (absent just compensation) to withdraw benefits it has conveyed or to qualify those benefits as it chooses when “the statute itself or surrounding circumstances” indicate that the conveyances were “intended to be irrevocable.” Opinion, ¶ 50 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, at the risk of belaboring the point, the statutory scheme clearly provided that a license to “acquire, breed, grow, keep, pursue, handle, harvest, use, sell, or dispose of the alternative livestock and their progeny in any quantity and at any time of year” was intended to be irrevocable, except if the licensee engaged in misconduct. Sections 87-4-412(1), -414(2), -423(1), -427(1), MCA (1999). There is neither evidence nor argument in this case that the Ranchers engaged in misconduct.</p>

Opinion, ¶¶ 51-53. On this basis, the Court concludes that the Ranchers’ licenses “did not meet the three required criteria for compensability under Members” and, thus, are not compensable property interests. Opinion, ¶ 54. The Court never explains, however, why an inability to exclude others from entering the industry is dispositive of the “property” question. The Ranchers do not claim a property right in the alternative livestock industry, so why would they need to exclude others from it? Rather, according to the Court, they claim a property right in their licenses, and each Rancher obviously had <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>title in his or her license to the exclusion of all others. In any event, the Court is flat wrong in asserting that the right to exclude is dispositive of the “property” question. “Precedent shows that the ability to exercise every one of the ‘sticks’ (rights) in the ‘bundle’ of fee simple rights at the time of a taking is not a prerequisite to establishing a valid property interest under the Fifth Amendment.” <em>Cienega Gardens v.

Rather, the prohibition on fee shooting was a means to an end-namely, to shut down all alternative livestock ranches. Consequently, 1-143 differs from regulations that “adjust” the regulatory scheme in order to directly address a matter of public concern, such as the new fencing requirements imposed on alternative livestock ranches over the years and the moratorium placed on new applications for initial alternative livestock ranch licenses until a test for chronic wasting disease is developed and approved. While such regulations may incidentally impact the value of businesses in the industry, they are not even remotely in the same league as 1-143, which did not “regulate” alternative livestock ranches in the usual sense, but instead deliberately wiped out the economic viability of these businesses. A voter initiative prompted by dissatisfaction with insurance companies and which permitted such companies to continue issuing policies but prohibited them from charging premiums would achieve much the same result, as would an initiative that permitted coal-fired generation plants to continue operating but prohibited them from charging for the electricity they provided, or an initiative that permitted oil companies to continue selling gasoline but prohibited them from charging anything at the pump, or an initiative that permitted banks to continue loaning money but prohibited them from charging interest, or an initiative that permitted grain farmers to continue harvesting their crops but prohibited them from charging for their wheat. Obviously, the list is endless.</p>

Rather, it deliberately and effectively legislated all such businesses out of existence. As a result, the values incident to the Ranchers’ property were not merely “diminished”; they were largely obliterated. <em>Cf. Martin v.

I agree. On the other hand, however, the Court suggests that the Ranchers should have reasonably anticipated such changes given the “highly regulated” nature of the alternative livestock industry. Opinion, ¶ 93. In so doing, the Court ignores several critical facts supporting the Ranchers’ investment-backed expectations in that industry. For one, the Legislature told the Ranchers that alternative livestock ranching was “a viable economic opportunity.” Section 87-4-431, MCA (1999). The Ranchers were also assured that they would be allowed to continue operating their alternative livestock businesses so long as they paid the license renewal fees, complied with all recording and reporting requirements, and did not engage in misconduct. Sections 87-4-412(1), -423(1), -427(1), MCA. Now, of course, they are being told that they may continue operating, but that they must do so without any income. The point here, however, is that the regulatory scheme itself engendered reasonable investment-backed expectations. Those, combined with the significant economic impact 1-143 had on the Ranchers’ businesses and the extraordinary character of the regulation, lead me to conclude that 1-143 took the Ranchers’ goodwill and going-concern value.</p>

The Court first rejected the notion that the intangible nature of these assets precluded recovery, observing that since the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for the value of a business’s physical property, it also requires compensation for the value of intangible assets. <em>Kimball Laundry, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=338%20U.S.%201" class="citation" data-index="527">338 U.S. at 11</a>, 69 S.

In that case, the government condemned property upon which the condemnee had been operating a lounge. The condemnee had attempted to transfer the going-concern value of the business to another location but could not do so due to a restriction on the transfer of his liquor license. The issue on appeal, therefore, was “whether the going-concern value of a liquor lounge, operating under a valid city liquor license, is property taken, destroyed, or damaged by the state’s condemnation of the premises for which compensation should be given.” <em>Saugen, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=169%20N.W.2d%2037" class="citation" data-index="535">169 N.W.2d at 39</a>.

Moreover, I am not persuaded that an “ability to profit from fee-shooting” is compensable if the State “physically condemns or occupies” the Ranchers’ property but is not compensable if the State simply passes a regulation putting the Ranchers out of business. That the Court treats these two scenarios as constitutionally distinct, without a shred of authority for support, is troubling.</p>

These are existing, quantifiable, and compensable property interests, recognized as such in the cases cited above. Where the government deprives an owner of the goodwill and going-concern value of his business, it is a compensable taking of property. <em>Kimball Laundry, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=338%20U.S.%201" class="citation" data-index="555">338 U.S. at 13</a>, 69 S.

Moreover, I disagree with the Court’s entire discussion at ¶¶ 55-64. In order to reject the Ranchers’ legitimate takings claims, the Court manufactures a novel new rule: Although a business owner may be deprived of the goodwill and going-concern value of his business by either regulation or direct appropriation, he is entitled to compensation only in the latter circumstance. There is no logical reason, no persuasive justification, and no legal authority offered in support of this incongruous rule. What the Court fails to recognize is that the ultimate question in a Fifth Amendment regulatory takings analysis is whether the regulation is “so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.” <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=544%20U.S.%20528" class="citation" data-index="556">544 U.S. 528</a>, 537, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=125%20S.%20Ct.%202074" class="citation" data-index="557">125 S.

First, I tend to agree with the Court’s conclusion that 1-143 did not take the Ranchers’ real estate. Opinion, ¶ 80. However, there is a glaring omission from the <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>Court’s discussion: an analysis of the fixtures. The Court’s heading reads, “Appellants’ Real Estate Interests and Fixtures,” and the Court mentions fixtures several times in ¶¶ 80-83. Yet, nowhere is there a discrete analysis of the fixtures. Rather, the Court seems to lump them together with the land. This, in my view, is error. The Ranchers installed a number of fixtures on their property specifically designed for the purpose of operating alternative livestock ranches, including fences and certain outbuildings. To the extent 1-143 has rendered these fixtures valueless, I conclude that the Ranchers are entitled to just compensation for essentially the same reasons I concluded above that they are entitled to just compensation for the loss of their right to transfer their alternative livestock ranch licenses and businesses and for the loss of their intangible business assets.</p>

This, the Court recognizes, “seems to run afoul” of the rule that the State may not “ !forc[e] some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.’ ” Opinion, ¶ 86 (quoting <em>Armstrong v.

The Court points out that the State has not seized the Ranchers’ alternative livestock. True, but the alternative livestock no longer have any economically viable use, as the Court itself acknowledges in ¶ 85 (noting that the value of the livestock is “insufficient to even cover the cost of raising and maintaining [them]” and that the Ranchers “could only sell the alternative livestock at a loss”). That is tantamount to seizing the alternative livestock. <em>Cf. Lucas v.

The Court also contends that 1-143 merely prohibited one use of the Ranchers’ alternative livestock and left them open to exploit other uses of the livestock. For instance, the Court proposes that the Ranchers could sell the alternative livestock (admittedly, at a loss) to out-of-state markets or “allow others to shoot [the alternative livestock] in Montana, so long as no fee is charged.” Opinion, ¶ 87.

The regulations prohibited commercial transactions in parts of birds that had been legally killed before the birds came under the protection of the Acts. The appellees were engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts composed partly of the feathers of protected birds, and these artifacts existed before the regulations went into effect. One of the issues on appeal, therefore, was whether “the Eagle Protection and Migratory Bird Treaty Acts violate appellees’ Fifth Amendment property rights because the prohibition [on commercial transactions in preexisting avian artifacts] wholly deprives them of the opportunity to earn a profit from those relics.” <em>See Andrus, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=444%20U.S.%2051" class="citation" data-index="565">444 U.S. at 52-55, 64</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=100%20S.%20Ct.%20383" class="citation" data-index="566">100 S.

The Court ultimately concluded that in the absence of any physical property restriction, the reduction in profits-i.e., the difference between the most profitable use of the property pre-regulation and the most profitable use of the property post-regulation-was too speculative and, thus, “a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim.” <em>Andrus, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=444%20U.S.%2051" class="citation" data-index="569">444 U.S. at 66</a>, 100 S.

Rather, it was designed to regulate the price of penned hunts so as to eliminate the alternative livestock’s value completely. It is important, in this regard, to recall that the Sportsmen’s concerns in drafting 1-143 were with chronic wasting disease (“CWD”), unethical hunting, and private ownership of game animals. Obviously, all of these concerns could be resolved in one fell swoop by simply seizing the alternative livestock and prohibiting private ownership of game animals, but such action clearly would require the payment of compensation. Alternatively, the Sportsmen’s goals could be achieved if the Ranchers were left with no choice but to get rid of their alternative livestock, but that would not likely occur if the Ranchers were able to derive economic benefit from them. Thus, the Sportsmen “carefully crafted” 1-143 to eliminate all economically beneficial use of the alternative livestock.</p>

First, the history of alternative livestock ranching does not support the expectations the Court attributes to the Ranchers. The “public unrest” that led to 1-143 was not new. As a matter of fact, the 1982 Game Farm Task Force was created specifically to address then-existing public concerns and controversy surrounding alternative livestock ranching. <em>See </em>Part II-A, <em>supra. </em>But that controversy did not lead to the out-and-out elimination of the industry. To the contrary, it resulted in a compromise involving, on one hand, the imposition of new requirements on alternative livestock ranch operations and, on the other hand, the codification of certain “rights” designed to protect the interests of participants in the alternative livestock industry. Thus, if the Ranchers should have expected a change due to the “public unrest” existing in the 1990s, additional safety and testing requirements are far more plausible than a regulation designed to put them out of business by prohibiting remuneration for penned hunts.

Therefore, even if the Ranchers <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>should have anticipated some adjustments to the regulatory scheme, a prohibition on charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock cannot fairly be categorized as one such adjustment-especially since penned hunts are still perfectly legal, as long as they are conducted for free.</p>

It is quite far-fetched to assert, as the Court does, that the Ranchers should have anticipated the State was on the verge of abolishing alternative livestock ranching when the Legislature, meanwhile, was passing a statute characterizing the activity as “a viable economic opportunity.” Given that alternative livestock ranching had been a lawful “business or occupation” in this State for over 75 years, and given that an alternative livestock ranch license was renewable as a matter of right and could not be revoked unless the licensee engaged in misconduct, §§ 87-4-412(1), -423(1), -427(1), MCA, it was far more reasonable for the Ranchers to maintain investment-backed expectations that their ability to continue operating their alternative livestock ranches was secure.</p>

If the meaning of “taking” may be qualified by the degree to which a regulation is “reasonably anticipated,” then “the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears.” <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.

Indeed, this expectation, according to the Court, outweighs even a “significant devaluation” of property disproportionately placed on the business. Such an approach drains the doctrine of “regulatory takings” of all force and purpose. There is no basis in logic or in the Takings Clause for distinguishing between two equally burdened property owners on the ground that one of them had advance notice of the regulation while the other was caught completely off guard. Either private property rights were taken, or they were not. If the former, just compensation must be paid, irrespective of the amount of notice the property owner had of the regulation’s enactment.</p>

While we may disagree as to the reasonableness of the Ranchers’ investment-backed expectations in light of the “significant public unrest,” I believe that the three factors, taken together, mandate the conclusion that 1-143 effected a taking of the Ranchers’ alternative livestock. Both the economic impact of 1-143 on the value of the alternative livestock and the character of the regulation weigh heavily in favor of this conclusion.</p>

It purported to address a number of “problems” associated with alternative livestock ranching, but it did not actually address any of those problems-at least, not directly. Instead, it eliminated the means whereby the Ranchers businesses existed, thereby destroying those businesses. The voters were not told that the Initiative was a “carefully crafted” end-around the Constitution that could lead to a decision from this Court holding that the State may destroy the goodwill and going-concern value of a Montana business, substantially (if not completely) devalue the business’s assets, and deprive the business owner of her right to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer the business-all without having to pay just compensation.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[176,949,1321,715]]]'>¶243 The Court invokes notions of “fairness and justice” to deny the Ranchers any compensation for the out-and-out obliteration of their businesses. 1-143 was designed to shut down an industry that the State had facilitated, and even encouraged, for 83 years and to place the entire economic burden of doing so on the participants in that industry. It is difficult to see any fairness or justice in this bait and switch, particularly since the Initiative was promoted as addressing legitimate public concerns shared not only by the Sportsmen, but by the public as a whole. A majority of voters-specifically, 204,282 of them-believed that the concerns cited by I-143’s Proponents warranted “game farm reform.” Given the severity of the burden this “reform” entailed, and given that the “reform” was intended to benefit all of Montana, fairness and justice require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation, not disproportionately placed on the shoulders of the alternative livestock ranchers.</p>

The character of the governmental action-total abrogation of property rights in and related to the Ranchers’ businesses-is extraordinary. And the Ranchers’ distinct investment-backed expectations in their ability to continue operating their businesses were quite reasonable in light of the history of alternative livestock ranching and the various assurances set out in the statutory scheme. “[Wjhile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.” <em>Mahon, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=260%20U.S.%20393" class="citation" data-index="585">260 U.S. at 415</a>, 43 S.

This Dissent is long-and will, no doubt, be criticized by some for that. However, I believe that the important issues implicated by the Ranchers’ takings claims justified setting out, in detail, the reasons why federal takings jurisprudence is confused, often inconsistent, certainly not bulletproof, and not necessarily worthy of this Court’s “marching lockstep” with it. I hope this Dissent will give some future takings litigant the impetus and ammunition to challenge federal caselaw in arguing that her facially broader fundamental rights under Article II, Section 29 should be upheld.</p>

Similarly, I am concerned that today’s decision will encourage more “carefully crafted” initiatives and legislation which end-run constitutional guarantees and mislead voters with smoke and mirrors. Finally, I am concerned that, recognizing “If they can do it to them, they can do it to me,” citizens will propose and enact initiatives of the recent 1-154 ilk-poorly drafted, overbroad, and underinclusive. Indeed, we invite the Legislature to enact laws to protect constitutional rights when this Court refuses to define and enforce those rights.</p>
