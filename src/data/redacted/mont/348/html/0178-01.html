    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[330,466,1018,34]]]'>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[178,515,1325,437]]]'>¶6 This case arises from a dispute between the Tarltons and Kaufmans, landowners who own adjoining properties along Lolo Creek near the rural community of Lolo, Montana. According to both parties, the dispute arose sometime in 2005, after the Tarltons either installed or repaired several yard lights on their property. The Kaufmans contend that the lights “interfered with the natural night-time beauty of the rural setting, prevented [Mr. Kaufman] from practicing his astronomy hobby and forced Kim Kaufman to abandon her bedroom just so she could get some sleep.”</p>
    <p id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[181,959,1322,486]]]'>¶7 Shortly after the lights were repaired, Kim Kaufman asked Bob Tarlton to install shields over the lights. According to the Kaufmans, the Tarltons refused this request. The Tarltons claim they initially decided to keep the lights off, but that an incident involving an unidentifiable car in their driveway late one night convinced them to keep at least one of the lights on. After an additional complaint about the lights from the Kaufmans, which allegedly included an offer from the Kaufmans to pay for light shields, Bob Tarlton installed his own shield on one of the yard lights. After the installation of the shield, the Kaufmans and Tarltons apparently did not discuss the lights again.</p>
    <p id="ACu" data-blocks='[["BL_202.7",202,[181,1453,1322,581]]]'>¶8 Early in the summer of 2006, a separate conflict between the Tarltons and Kaufmans arose. This time, the dispute allegedly resulted from Bob Tarlton’s maintenance of a pond that spans both the Tarltons’ and Kaufmans’ properties. According to the Tarltons, Jim Kaufman was angered by the maintenance of the pond and allegedly told Bob Tarlton that he could not legally maintain it. Thereafter, Bob Tarlton approached the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (“DNRC”) to determine whether he could lawfully maintain the pond. According to the Tarltons, the DNRC stated he could. While distinct from the dispute over the yard lights, the disagreement over the pond allegedly contributed to a further deterioration of the relationship between the Tarltons and Kaufmans.</p>
    <p id="Anx" data-blocks='[["BL_202.8",202,[180,2042,1323,289]],["BL_203.1",203,[79,328,1324,189]]]'>¶9 In July of 2006, the Kaufmans began constructing the fence that is the subject of this dispute. When complete, the chain link fence stood approximately 20 feet above a newly constructed 6-foot high berm, measured 270 feet in length, and was covered in two layers of dark material. The Tarltons argue that the fence does not enclose anything and that it is not supported structurally. The Tarltons also believe the <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>fence is a spite fence, constructed “solely to harass, annoy, and irritate” them. The Kaufmans, on the other hand, contend that the fence is structurally sound and that they had no choice but to take some measures to block the glare from the Tarltons’ yard lights.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[78,527,1330,682]]]'>¶10 The Tarltons initiated the present action following the construction of the fence, alleging in Count I of their complaint that the fence constituted a nuisance under § 27-30-101, MCA. Specifically, the Tarltons alleged that the fence destroyed the aesthetic value of their property, that it reduced the value of their property, that it destroyed their view, and that it was an eyesore. Count II of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment from the District Court that the Kaufmans’ fence was a spite fence. The Tarltons also claimed they were entitled to injunctive relief and asked for punitive damages. The Kaufmans counterclaimed that the Tarltons’ yard lights constituted a nuisance, stating that the lights “unreasonably interfered] with the Kaufmans’ pursuit of their hobbies, disturbed] wildlife in the area and interfered] with the Kaufmans’ general use and enjoyment of their property.”</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[78,1219,1324,236]]]'>¶11 Following the initiation of this action, both parties made several procedural maneuvers, few of which are relevant to this appeal. However, the Tarltons do contend on appeal that the District Court erred by either granting or denying a variety of motions, which we now explain.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[76,1465,1325,386]]]'>¶12 The first motion in contention on appeal is the Kaufmans’ motion to dismiss Count II (Declaratory Judgment) of the Tarltons’ complaint. Despite the Tarltons’ argument that the District Court could appropriately declare the fence a spite fence under the Montana Declaratory Judgments Act, the District Court dismissed the claim, reasoning that the question of “[w]hether the fence is a spite fence involves numerous disputed questions of fact, which are properly the subject of trial on the merits.”</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.7",203,[75,1861,1325,485]],["BL_204.1",204,[184,318,1274,42]]]'>¶13 The second motion in contention on appeal is a motion <em>in limine </em>filed by the Kaufmans prior to trial. In this motion, the Kaufmans asked the District Court to exclude any evidence that the fence violated “any county ordinance” or that it is “unpermitted or illegal” on the basis that such evidence is “irrelevant and immaterial to the issue of whether the fence at issue in this case was constructed solely for the purpose of harassing or annoying the Tarltons.” The Tarltons argued that the evidence, although arguably prejudicial, was not <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial to the Kaufmans. The District Court granted the Kaufmans’ motion to exclude the introduction of any evidence that the <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>fence violated a county ordinance, was unpermitted, or was illegal.</p>
    <p id="ADi" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[183,368,1323,477]]]'>¶14 The third motion in contention on appeal is a pre-trial motion filed by the Tarltons requesting a jury view of the properties. The Tarltons argued to the District Court that any photographs and other evidence depicting the fence would not “offer the best evidence of the situation.” The Kaufmans objected to the Tarltons’ motion for a jury view of the premises, arguing that the evidence sought to be introduced at trial was “sufficient for the jurors to resolve the material issues of fact in this case.” The District Court denied the Tarltons’ request for a jury view at the close of the trial after determining that the photographs and other evidence introduced at trial were sufficient.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[184,860,1322,779]]]'>¶15 Also in contention on appeal is a jury instruction which included the statement, “[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.” The instruction, proposed by the Kaufmans prior to trial, was strenuously objected to by the Tarltons on the basis that the instruction misstated Montana’s law on nuisance by including limiting language on unsightliness and view obstruction. The Kaufmans, on the other hand, argued that the instruction appropriately reflected Montana law. Ultimately, the District Court adopted the Kaufmans’ proposed instruction with the limiting language as Instruction 13, adding only the word “generally” before the statement, “[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.” In addition to the instruction for the Tarltons’ nuisance claim, the District Court also gave instructions for the spite fence claim and for the Kaufmans’ nuisance claim against the Tartlons regarding the lights.</p>
    <p id="A2M" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[184,1649,1321,238]]]'>¶16 Following a three-day trial, the jury unanimously found that the Kaufmans’ fence was not a nuisance or a spite fence, that the Kaufmans were not required to remove the fence, and that the Tarltons’ lights were not a nuisance. The jury foreperson included a statement at the end of the special verdict form, which stated:</p>

In denying this motion, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>the District Court stated, “[t]here are no reasonable grounds for taking the case from the jury and deciding it as a matter of law.” The Tarltons appeal.</p>

    <p id="b206-11" data-blocks='[["BL_206.11",206,[181,964,1322,285]]]'>The Kaufmans argued to the District Court that <em>“a </em>simple statement of the statutory definition [of nuisance] would not provide jurors with an accurate and complete statement of the law” and that, therefore, it was necessary for the District Court to include the statement that “[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.”</p>
    <p id="b206-12" data-blocks='[["BL_206.12",206,[180,1258,1323,582]]]'>¶21 The Tarltons objected to the Kaufmans’ proposed instruction, arguing to the District Court that the instruction for nuisance should be limited to the plain language of the statute. They stated that “the problem with [the Kaufmans’] theory ... is that they are relying on California law (which does not actually say what [the Kaufmans] are representing, and which has a much higher population and much higher density of building than does Montana).” Ultimately, the District Court adopted, nearly verbatim, the Kaufmans’ proposed instruction on nuisance as Instruction 13, adding only the word “generally” to the statement that, “[a] structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.”</p>

The Tarltons claim that this portion of the instruction is contrary to Montana’s definition of nuisance, which provides that “[a]nything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... is a nuisance.” Section 27-30-101(1), MCA. The Tarltons claim that Instruction 13 “is problematic because it require[d] the jury to apply a legal standard that is not a Montana legal standard,” and further, that the jury <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>should have “simply been instructed on Montana’s nuisance law as set forth in § 27-30-101(1), MCA.” Finally, the Tarltons claim that “[t]he use of the word ‘anything* by the Montana Legislature means what it says-anything.” Therefore, according to the Tarltons, the definition could “include an eyesore (such as the Kaufmans’ fence) or destruction of a person’s enjoyment of the view of public land (such as the Tarltons’ view of the Lolo Peak area and the Lolo Creek drainage).” Based on this alleged instructional error, the Tarltons ask this Court to reverse the judgment and grant a new trial in this case.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[72,773,1329,533]]]'>¶23 The Kaufmans reiterate on appeal that Instruction 13 “correctly instructed the jury on the Montana law of private nuisance in the context of claims based upon obstruction of view or aesthetic considerations.” The Kaufmans also state that Instruction 13 is “both consistent with Montana’s statutory definition of nuisance and applicable case law interpreting that definition.” The Kaufmans argue that it is proper for this Court to look to California’s pattern jury instructions for guidance on this issue and to California’s case law interpreting § 27-30-101, MCA, given that Montana’s definition of nuisance is modeled after, and nearly identical with, California’s definition of nuisance. <em>See </em>Cal.

Importantly, there is no relevant statutory authority in Montana for including the statement that “[glenerally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.” Montana’s definition of nuisance, which applies to both public and private nuisance claims, states clearly that “[ajnything which is injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property ... is a nuisance.” Section 27-30-101(1), MCA. Except for limitations on farming operations and activities authorized by statute, the additional nuisance statutes set forth in Chapter 30 of the Montana Code Annotated do not provide further limitations on what may or may not constitute a nuisance in Montana. <em>See </em>Sections 27-30-101(2) through -(3), MCA.</p>

In <em>Barnes, </em>we dealt with whether a statutorily authorized sewer and storm drain system installed by the City of Thompson Falls constituted a nuisance under § 27-30-101(2). <em>Belue, </em>a similar case relied on by the Kaufmans, is also not applicable to the facts of the present case. In <em>Belue, </em>we addressed whether a slag pile that had been in an area for a number of years constituted a public or private nuisance. In neither <em>Barnes </em>nor <em>Belue </em>did we address the question of whether a fence’s (or similar structure’s) unsightliness or view obstruction could or could not be factors of a nuisance claim in Montana. Finally, the Kaufmans’ reliance on our decision in <em>McCollum </em>is also inapposite. The Kaufmans rely heavily on our decision in <em>McCollum </em>for the proposition that “a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly ....” In support of their argument, the Kaufmans point to our statement in <em>McCollum </em>that “evidence as to the unsightly condition of the premises or structures would not alone make the condition a public nuisance.” <em>McCollum, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=131%20Mont.%20438" class="citation" data-index="19">131 Mont. at 444</a>, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=311%20P.2d%20780" class="citation" data-index="20">311 P.2d at </a>783 (citing <em>People v.

Specifically, the plaintiff in <em>McCollum </em>complained about the noise, smells, and cleanliness associated with the chicken coops and argued that the structures were a fire hazard as well as unsightly. The plaintiffs primary argument was that the chicken coops were constructed without a permit in violation of a city ordinance and that such a violation constituted a nuisance per se. Ultimately, we held that the chicken coops did not constitute a public nuisance. However, our holding was primarily based upon our determination that a violation of a municipal ordinance generally does not constitute a nuisance per se or a public nuisance. Furthermore, the structures in <em>McCollum </em>were not unusual in their size or composition, and the plaintiffs argument was based largely on the smells, noise, dust, and insects associated with the chicken coops. The plaintiff did not make any allegation of view obstruction. Here, however, the structure complained of is a massive fence, approximately 26 feet in height, which is covered in dark material. Further, our statement about unsightliness in <em>McCollum </em>did not address the question of whether unsightliness and view obstruction (or unsightliness in combination with any additional <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>factor(s)), could constitute a nuisance in Montana. In the absence of any factually relevant case law in support of limiting nuisance on the basis of both unsightliness and view obstruction, and in light of Montana’s expansive statutory definition of nuisance, we conclude that the limitations on unsightliness and view obstruction articulated in Instruction 13 were inaccurate statements of Montana law.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[73,632,1327,983]]]'>¶27 The Kaufmans also cite our decisions in <em>Barnes, Belue, </em>and <em>McCollum </em>in support of the claim that this Court has looked to California to interpret Montana’s law on nuisance, and that courts in California have stated that nuisance claims cannot rest solely on view and aesthetic considerations. <em>See Venuto </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=22%20Cal.%20App.%203d%20116" class="citation" data-index="23">22 Cal.

Rptr. 350</a>, 357 (1971) (stating the general proposition that “a building or structure cannot be complained of as a nuisance <em>merely </em>because it obstructs the view from neighboring property’); <em>see also Oliver v.

Therefore, according to the Kaufmans, the limiting language on view and aesthetic considerations was an accurate statement of the law. However, this discussion does not require an investigation of California nuisance law since our analysis considers only the question of whether the District Court fully and fairly instructed the jury on Montana’s nuisance law. Since the Montana Legislature has not narrowed the definition of what constitutes a nuisance, we are not at liberty to do so here.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[71,1623,1326,733]],["BL_210.1",210,[187,328,1159,43]]]'>¶28 Also, despite the Kaufmans’ argument to the contrary, we do not agree that Instruction 13 was proper due, in part, to its basis on California’s pattern jury instruction. Notably, a review of California’s pattern jury instruction for private nuisance makes clear that it does not include a limitation on unsightliness or view obstruction. <em>See </em>Jud. Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instr. 2021 (rev. Feb. 2007). The text of the pattern instruction generally mirrors California’s statutory definition of nuisance, which, as noted earlier, is nearly identical to Montana’s definition of nuisance found in § 27-30-101(1), MCA, but the instruction does not limit what may constitute a nuisance in California or include the statement that “[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.” Presumably, the limiting language was not included in the text of the pattern instruction because to do so, as we note later in this discussion, would be confusing <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>to a jury given the broad definition of nuisance in California.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[187,378,1327,1314]]]'>¶29 Furthermore, Instruction 13, when viewed in its entirety, is internally inconsistent. The second sentence stating that “[generally, a structure or condition cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view” stands in direct contrast with the broad language of § 27-30-101(1), MCA. We find this to have been both misleading and confusing to the jury. The limitation on unsightliness and view obstruction appears to limit what <em>could </em>constitute a nuisance under the language in subpart 2 of Instruction 13, which required the jury to find that the Kaufmans, by building the fence, created a condition that was either injurious to health, indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property. At trial, the Kaufmans’ attorney even admitted that the fence “is not attractive” and that the “fence partially blocks [the Tarltons’] view.” Based on this statement, the jury could have found that the fence was “indecent or offensive to the senses” but were precluded from doing so by the limiting language set forth in the first half of Instruction 13. Additional statements made by the Kaufmans’ attorney during closing arguments also contributed to the confusion in this case. Of particular note is the following statement: “There’s no doubt that the fence isn’t nice to look at. I’m not surprised they don’t like looking at it. And there’s no doubt that it blocks a portion of their view. Those don’t constitute nuisances.” When these contentions were objected to, the District Court invited the jury to “look at the instructions.” In this case, the jury instruction’s internal inconsistencies made it difficult for the jury to scrutinize whether these statements were accurate representations of Montana’s law on nuisance.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[187,1709,1326,376]]]'>¶30  Lastly, Instruction 13 was prejudicial to the Tarltons. The wording of Instruction 13 clearly emphasized the limitation on unsightliness and view obstruction in the first half of the instruction, which we have determined improperly limited the definition of nuisance in Montana. Given these considerations, Instruction 13 did not fully and fairly instruct the jury, and, consequently, the District Court erred in including the limiting language on unsightliness and view obstruction in Instruction 13.</p>

Before the District Court, the Tarltons stated that they simply wanted the District Court “to declare their rights, to declare that the fence is a spite fence, and to declare that the fence needs to be removed.” The Tarltons even went so far as to base their claim for declaratory relief in Article II, Section III of the Montana Constitution, which provides that Montanans have the right to a clean and healthful environment. Specifically, the Tarltons argue that their “rights and use and <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>enjoyment of their property are constitutional and the Kaufmans have interfered with their constitutional rights.”</p>

We stated that a spite fence is one that serves “no beneficial use or pleasure to the owner but was erected and is maintained for the purpose of annoying a neighbor.” <em>Haugen v. Kottas, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2001%20MT%20274" class="citation" data-index="32">2001 MT 274</a>, ¶ 15, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=307%20Mont.%20301" class="citation" data-index="33">307 Mont. 301</a>, ¶ 15, P.3d 672, ¶ 15 (citing 1 Am. Jur. <em>2d. Adjoining Landowners </em>§ 106). It is clear that, in this case, it would have been improper for the District Court to declare that the Kaufmans’ fence was a spite fence since the question of whether the fence failed to serve any beneficial use or pleasure to the Kaufmans or that the fence was erected and maintained to annoy the Tarltons were questions of fact appropriate for a trial on the merits. Further, the decision to dismiss the Tartlons’ request for declaratory judgment was within the sound discretion of the District Court. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err by dismissing Count II of the Tarltons’ complaint for declaratory judgment.

The Kaufmans, however, argue that they were initially not aware of the permitting process or building codes and that they took the necessary steps to secure a permit for the fence as soon as they became aware of the building codes.</p>

We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence that the Kaufmans’ fence violated, for at least a certain time period, the local building codes. The determination that such evidence would have the tendency to confuse the jury was within the sound discretion of the District Court, and consistent with M. R. Evid. 403, which states, “[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” Notably, the District Court also excluded evidence that the Kaufmans ultimately secured a permit for the fence.

The Kaufmans, in objecting to the Tarltons’ motion for a jury view, argued that it “would be impractical, add to the costs of the litigation and would be unfair because the material conditions of the property had changed significantly since the lawsuit had been filed.”</p>

    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[65,1331,1335,434]]]'>¶47 The parties spent three days presenting their cases to the jury. The parties, not surprisingly, haggled over the proper instruction of nuisance to be given to the jury. The jury returned a verdict that the fence did not constitute a nuisance. The jury conversely determined that the Tarltons’ mercury vapor lighting did not constitute a nuisance. The jury finally determined that the Kaufmans’ fence did not qualify as a “spite fence” under the circumstances presented here. I dissent from the Court’s failure to defer to the jury’s reasoned judgment.</p>
    <p id="b215-6" data-blocks='[["BL_215.7",215,[68,1775,1326,586]]]'>¶48 As the Court notes, we must “‘consider the jury instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial.’” (quoting <em>Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, </em>2007 MT140, ¶ 74, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=337%20Mont.%20411" class="citation" data-index="37">337 Mont. 411</a>, ¶ 74, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=162%20P.3d%20106" class="citation" data-index="38">162 P.3d 106</a>, ¶ 74). The jury instructions in this matter included an instruction for nuisance on the fence, and instruction for nuisance on the mercury vapor lighting, and an instruction for a “spite fence.” The Court must consider the separate nuisance instructions and the “spite fence” instructions together in evaluating whether the jury instructions, in their entirety, correctly stated the law. <em>Murphy Homes, </em>Inc., ¶ 74. We also must remember that the Kaufmans filed a nuisance claim of their own regarding the Tarltons’ mercury vapor lighting.</p>

      <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>¶49 The nuisance instruction relating to the fence contained the admonition that “[generally, a structure cannot constitute a nuisance merely because it is considered unsightly or because it obstructs a party’s view.” The instruction proceeded to set forth the elements for a nuisance claim. The Tarltons objected only to the admonitory language and raised no concern with the remainder of the instruction.</p>
    <p id="Al5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[196,629,1322,388]]]'>¶50 The District Court instructed the jury on the Kaufmans’ nuisance claim in a manner nearly identical to the Tarltons’ nuisance claim with one exception. The jury instruction on the Tarltons’ nuisance claim contained the admonitory “generally” provision. The jury instruction on the Kaufmans’ nuisance claim instead provided in its introductory paragraph that light shining on another’s property “may constitute a nuisance where the intensity of the light is strong enough to <em>seriously </em>disturb a person of normal sensitivities.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[191,1024,1327,532]]]'>¶51 The District Court balanced its admonitory language regarding “generally” in the nuisance instruction regarding the fence with the provision that the jury could not consider the Tarltons’ mercury vapor lighting to constitute a nuisance unless the lights “seriously” disturbed the Kaufmans’ enjoyment of their property. Nothing in Montana’s statutory definition of nuisance, set forth in § 27-30-101, MCA, limits a nuisance to those things that “seriously” disturb a person’s enjoyment of their property. Likewise, nothing in California’s pattern jury instruction for private nuisance limits a nuisance to those things that “seriously” disturb a person’s enjoyment of their property. Jud. Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instr. 2021 (rev. Feb. 2007).</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[196,1564,1322,338]]]'>¶52 The District Court’s jury instructions on the Tarltons’ “spite fence” claim provided further context. These instructions provided first that no property owner has the right “to erect and maintain an otherwise useless structure for the sole purpose of injuring his neighbor.” The “spite fence” instruction further provided that a “spite fence” is “of no beneficial use” to the party and that the party built the “spite fence” “solely to harass and anno/’ their neighbors.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.7",216,[192,1910,1326,387]]]'>¶53 The jury rejected the Tarltons’ “spite fence” claim and in doing so, rejected the notion that the Kauffman’s fence constituted an “otherwise useless structure.” The jury also explicitly rejected the contention that the Kaufmans had built the fence “for the sole purpose” of harassing and annoying the Tarltons. As implied by the jury’s verdict, and made explicit by the jury’s recommendation, the jury determined that the Kaufmans had built the fence to block the light emitting from the Tarltons’ mercury vapor lights.</p>

      <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>¶54 In the context of the evidence presented to the jury in this case, the District Court did not act arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed the bounds of reason when it included the admonitory “generally” language in the jury instruction on the Tarltons’ nuisance claim. <em>Kiely Const., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em><a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=2002%20MT%20241" class="citation" data-index="39">2002 MT 241</a>, ¶ 92, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=312%20Mont.%2052" class="citation" data-index="40">312 Mont. 52</a>, ¶ 92, <a href="http://cite.case.test:8000/citations/?q=57%20P.3d%20836" class="citation" data-index="41">57 P.3d 836</a>, ¶ 92. I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the jury instructions, taken in their entirety, did not state the law of nuisance fully and fairly. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc., </em>¶ 74. I dissent on this issue. I concur with the remainder of the Court’s opinion.</p>
