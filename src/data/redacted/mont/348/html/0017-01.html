The decree provided that if Drollinger moved from the Quinn Creek Road property prior to May 13,2010, the property was to be sold. The decree also ordered the parties to share equally in the expense of the mortgage. In regard to Stoneman’s obligation to pay his share of the mortgage, the decree stated “[i]f <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>[Stoneman] is in default of any mortgage payment he shall forfeit all of his interest in the Quinn Creek Road property.” The decree also ordered Stoneman to pay child support in the amount of $190 per month each for the parties’ four children.</p>

      <em>A. Facts Pertaining to the Rental and Sale of the Quinn Creek Road Property</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b41-7" data-blocks='[["BL_41.6",41,[83,1223,1330,824]]]'>¶9 After Drollinger moved from the Quinn Creek Road property in September 1999, Stoneman filed a Motion for Possession of the Home in which he requested that the court transfer possession of the property to him or allow him to sell the property and divide the proceeds pursuant to the decree. After ahearing on February 18,2000, the District Court ordered that the property be listed for sale within fifteen days and be sold on or before June 1, 2000. The parties were unable to agree on a realtor or on a number of other points related to the sale and the property was ultimately never sold. Stoneman filed a motion on July 24, 2000, requesting that the court approve a monthly rental agreement for the Quinn Creek Road property with a family of proposed tenants-the Traders. In its August 17, 2000 order, the District Court granted Stoneman’s motion and ordered him to pay the rental proceeds to the clerk of the District Court, with those proceeds to be disbursed to cover the monthly mortgage obligation. The court ordered the balance of the proceeds to be paid to Drollinger with half of that balance to be credited to Stoneman’s child support obligation.</p>
    <p id="AzO" data-blocks='[["BL_41.7",41,[82,2052,1325,336]],["BL_42.1",42,[191,333,1322,286]]]'>¶10 On January 9, 2001, Stoneman filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to make mortgage payments directly to CitiMortgage after he received two late payment notices. In response, Drollinger filed a Motion for Renters to Make Payments to Clerk of Court. Drollinger alleged that Stoneman had ceased making rental payments to the clerk of the District Court as he had been ordered. Drollinger provided a letter from CitiMortgage stating that the mortgage was in default. <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>In the District Court’s September 10, 2001 order, the court found the system of making payments to the clerk of the District Court was inefficient and instead ordered Stoneman to make the mortgage payments directly to the lender. The court required Stoneman to file a copy of the payment check with the clerk of the District Court at least one week prior to the time payment was due.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[191,626,1327,724]]]'>¶11 Citing the language in the decree of dissolution regarding forfeiture of Stoneman’s interest in the Quinn Creek Road property if he failed to make the mortgage payments, Drollinger filed a Motion to Enforce Property Provisions of Decree of Dissolution on December 30, 2004. She requested that the District Court transfer Stoneman’s interest in the Quinn Creek Road property to her, due to Stoneman’s alleged failure to make mortgage payments. In her motion, Drollinger cited Stoneman’s testimony during Drollinger’s bankruptcy proceeding that he had not been making the mortgage payments since ordered to do so in the September 10, 2001 order. Drollinger also stated that CitiMortgage had initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in October 2001, but that the balance due on the mortgage had been satisfied by the payment of $106,179.61, representing the $70,743.75 balance on the mortgage plus $35,435.86 in costs and attorney’s fees, by Drollinger’s father.</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[191,1357,1327,432]]]'>¶12 The District Court held a hearing on Drollinger’s motion on April 1, 2005, and subsequently issued an order denying her motion. The District Court stated that “[i]t is undisputed that Stoneman has not continued to make mortgage payments on the marital property,” but concluded that equity would not be served by ordering forfeiture of Stoneman’s interest given the changing circumstances and multitude of intervening orders which had subsequently been entered. The court also ordered the parties to file proposals regarding the issues that remained to be resolved by May 12, 2005.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.6",42,[192,1797,1322,577]],["BL_43.1",43,[92,335,773,33]]]'>¶13 Drollinger’s report of remaining issues identified two issues for resolution by the court: (1) “Whether Stoneman is responsible for payment of any portion of the penalty, interest, accrued late fees, attorney’s fees and penalties in connection with the mortgage on the parties’ residence to Citibank Mortgage Company, paid by Drollinger,” and (2) “Whether Stoneman is responsible for payment of the rent from the parties’ residence per the Court’s previous Orders to Drollinger, and if so, the amount due to Drollinger.” In its May 26, 2006 Order Regarding Remaining Issues, the District Court noted that these were the only two issues brought before the court by the May 12, 2005 deadline, and thus, would be the only two remaining issues to be further considered by the court, despite both parties having filed <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>numerous documents after the deadline.</p>
    <p id="b43-4" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[89,384,1331,725]]]'>¶14 Drollinger argued that the rental income owed to her should be based upon Stoneman’s testimony at an August 10, 2000 hearing that he was able to rent the Quinn Creek Road property for $1,200 a month. Drollinger claimed that she was entitled to payment from Stoneman for all the months since the August 17, 2000 order at a rate of $1,200 per month less a $270 per month child support credit. In its May 26, 2006 order, the District Court concluded that $1,200 was the reasonable rental value and that Drollinger should be credited for half of this value from August 17,2000, until April 1,2005. As there was no evidence as to who controlled the property from April 1, 2005, to the time of the order, the District Court set a hearing to make this determination. The court also ordered that the property be sold immediately in compliance with the decree of dissolution, as Drollinger had moved away, although the court acknowledged that the parties had disregarded previous orders to do so.</p>
    <p id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[87,1118,1327,618]]]'>¶15 After a hearing on January 26, 2007, the court issued an order noting that the parties had stipulated to the appointment of a receiver by the court to supervise the sale of the property. The court also concluded thatDrollinger’s father should recover $106,179.61 from the sale proceeds in reimbursement of his payment of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness and related expenses. The court again reaffirmed that $1,200 was a reasonable rental value for the property and ordered Stoneman to pay Drollinger half of the total rent from August 17, 2000, until the property was sold, at a rate of $600 per month. The District Court noted that $1,200 represented the reasonable value of Stoneman’s control of the property as Drollinger enjoyed no benefit from the use of the property while Stoneman was in control.</p>

Drollinger sought child support modification, arguing that the $760 per month set by the decree of dissolution was insufficient given Stoneman’s ability to pay. The motion contained numerous allegations about Stoneman’s ability to pay and his resistance to doing so. The District Court issued an order on April 3, 2006, in which it first noted that Drollinger had filed the child support motion after the May 12, 2005 deadline established by the court for designation of issues, and stating there was “no apparent good cause” to consider the child support issue. It did, however, declare that because the State of Washington had taken jurisdiction over issues of custody, visitation, and parenting, it would be in a better position to address the matter, and the District Court would not “undertake review separately.”</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[182,1067,1322,282]]]'>¶18 Several months later, Drollinger filed a motion arguing that Washington had not and could not assume jurisdiction over child support pursuant to the UIFSA. At a January 26, 2007 hearing, the District Court refused to consider Drollinger’s motion because the court had previously ordered, on April 3, 2006, that child support would not be considered any further by this jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[183,1357,1322,336]]]'>¶19 In spite of the District Court’s clear order and instruction that it would not consider the issue of child support any further, Drollinger filed a Motion to Reconsider Transfer of Jurisdiction on Child Support to Washington State, requesting that the District Court reconsider its earlier decision. However, before the court could take up this latest motion, Stoneman filed a notice of appeal. Drollinger responded by cross-appealing the child support issue.</p>

Stoneman further argues that the District Court disregarded additional testimony presented at the later January 26, 2007 hearing, and simply “piggybacked” its February 7, 2007 determination of rental value on the value previously set in the May 26, 2006 order.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Stoneman believed that $1100 was a fair rental value at the time. In February 2001 Stoneman rented to a Mr. Andersen in exchange for repairs to the property. Stoneman believed the rental value of the property did not diminish at the time. At the April 1, 2005 Hearing counsel for Drollinger asked, “So, you could have fairly collected $1200 a month for the property; is that right?” Stoneman replied, “Probably at that time.” Thus, Stoneman has conceded that although the house needed repairs he still could have collected $1200 a month in rent in April 2005.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b46-6" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[287,1213,1236,772]]]'>The Court previously determined that a reasonable rental value per month including the residence and surrounding pasture ground was $1,200.00 per month. The evidence elicited from Stoneman’s own witnesses corroborates that determination. The Court is inclined to take judicial notice that we all have lived in inflationary times since August 2000 which would farther erode Stoneman’s implicit argument that reasonable rent should be established at a lesser figure. The Court is not required to do so in order to find that a reasonable monthly rental is $1,200 per month. The salient consideration is the reasonable value of Stoneman’s control of the marital home and real estate. The issue is not how much rent he has collected. Drollinger has obtained no benefit from use of the property during that period of time. She is entitled to the sum of $600 per month from August 17,2000 until the property is sold. Stoneman is entitled to remain in sole possession.</blockquote>

Stoneman claims that the court failed to realize that the property had been ordered sold and that there should have been no rental value. Stoneman also points to the low amount of rent charged by Drollinger to several tenants after she vacated the property.

Nearly a year later, at the May 3, 2001 hearing, Stoneman testified that there was a tenant on the property paying $1,200 on a month to month lease. At the April 1, 2005 hearing, Drollinger stated that after she moved from the property in September 1999, she rented the property to a Montana State University student and received $330 in rent per month, but that the student also took care of Drollinger’s horses and managed the property. Drollinger noted that she later rented the property to another MSU student under the same terms, and that the rent was only $330 because of the services the renters provided in taking care of the horses and the property.</p>

When asked, “[s]o, you could have fairly collected $1200 a month for the property; is that right?” Stoneman replied, “[plrobably, at that time.” After Anderson, Stoneman testified that he lived on the property for approximately two years before renting it to Ralph and Claudia Dennis in July 2003. The Dennises paid $600 per month and, in addition, Stoneman testified that “Ralph said he was going to do some fix-up on the property to supplement that.”</p>

The Quinn Creek Road property had a three bedroom house on forty acres. When asked what rental amount would be reasonable for property such as the Quinn Creek Road property, Fuhrman replied, “I would say probably 600 to 900, and then if they had animals, maybe more.” Lindsay Patterson, a licensed assistant at a realty company testified that property located in a rural area would rent for $250 to $300 a bedroom.

Nor do we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in adopting $1,200 as the reasonable rental value of the property. The District Court noted that the issue was not solely how much rent Stoneman had collected from the tenants, but rather the reasonable value of the property under his control. “As long as the valuation of property in a dissolution is reasonable in light of all the evidence submitted, we will not disturb the finding on appeal.” <em>In re Marriage of Jackson, </em>¶ 15.</p>

Stoneman replies that the decree also obligated Drollinger to make half the mortgage payment but that she failed to do so.

In her notice of cross-appeal, Drollinger claims that she is appealing from both the April 3, 2006 order as well as the court’s later January 26, 2007 “oral order” regarding child support. However, a review of the January 26, 2007 hearing transcript demonstrates that the court simply reiterated that it would not consider the issue further because its order of April 3,2006, had finally settled the matter. In response to Drollinger’s renewed motion, the court stated “[t]hat’s moot. It needs no Order, it needs no action. This Court-this Judge previously ordered that child support is not going to be considered here in this venue, in this case any longer, or in this jurisdiction.”</p>
