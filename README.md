# capstone-static

The Caselaw Access Project is a large-scale digitization project hosted by the [Harvard Law School Library Innovation Lab](http://lil.law.harvard.edu/).

This is a static, archival port of the [website originally hosted at case.law](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone), which served court opinions and an accompanying suite of tools to users in a variety of formats. The static website uses client-side javascript to allow browsing of the static case data hosted at https://static.case.law.

This repository does not itself contain case data: visit the [website](https://case.law) to browse and download case data.
